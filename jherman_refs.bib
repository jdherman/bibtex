  Abstract                 = {We conduct a sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of the land-surface scheme {JULES} focusing on biophysical parameters and model processes that govern light propagation and canopy photosynthesis. We find that current simulations of productivity/energy-exchange are limited as much by their approximate representation of complex physical processes as they are by the accuracy to which their biophysical parameters can be specified. This inference is made for three forest biomes: sparse, boreal needleleaf; dense, tropical broadleaf; and temperate broadleaf of intermediate density. Within the present study, the most influential biophysical parameters are light-limited quantum efficiency ({\^{I}}$\pm$), the Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis at the top of the canopy (Vcmax) and the near-infrared transmittance of vegetation ({TNIR).} Assuming respective, current uncertainties of 0.02, 20 {\^{I}}$\sfrac{1}{4}$mol/m2/s and 0.16 in these aforementioned parameters, predictions of Gross Photosynthetic Product ({GPP)}, latent heat ({LE)}, sensible heat (H) and upwelling thermal radiation (R) vary by {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}$\sfrac{1}{4}$20\%, {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}$\sfrac{1}{4}$10\%, {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}$\sfrac{1}{4}$35\% and {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}$\sfrac{1}{4}$0.3\%, respectively. Current representations of canopy photosynthesis and stomatal conductance yield comparable uncertainties in simulated {GPP} and {LE} and a {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}$\sfrac{1}{4}$60\% uncertainty in H. For canopy photosynthesis, explicit treatment of sunfleck penetration and leaf orientation are important elements in the calculation. Of the meteorological variables that drive the land-surface scheme, the downwelling fluxes of radiation in the shortwave and longwave vie in importance with the most influential biophysical parameters. The results from our study are partly biome-dependent. Thus ground albedo and leaf area index ({LAI)} assume greater importance in sparsely vegetated systems.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper evaluates the use of a small number of generalist parameter sets as an alternative to classical calibration. Here parameter sets are considered generalist when they yield acceptable performance on a large number of catchments. We tested the genericity of an initial collection of 106 parameter sets sampled in the parameter space for the four-parameter {GR}4J rainfall-runoff model. A short-list of 27 generalist parameter sets was obtained as a good compromise between model efficiency and length of the short-list. A different data set was used for an independent evaluation of a calibration procedure, in which the search for an optimum parameter set is only allowed within this short-list. In validation mode, the performance obtained is inferior to that of a classical calibration, but when the amount of data available for calibration is reduced, the generalist parameter sets become progressively more competitive, with better results for calibration series shorter than 1 year.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the growing economic importance of tourism, and its impact on relative water shortage, little is known about the role that water plays in the productive process of hotels and restaurants and, therefore, the possible implications of water demand management policy for this sector. This study aims to fill this gap. It is based on the microdata of 676 firms in the sector, operating in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) for a 12-year period. Based on the Translog cost function, we estimate the shadow price of water in the short-run and, from a long-run perspective, its direct price elasticity, its cross elasticities relative to labour, capital and supplies, and its elasticity with respect to the level of output. The results obtained show that water provides sector firms returns that are on average higher than its price, although in the case of hotels the margin is really narrow. This situation provides policy makers with a margin for applying price increases without affecting the sector's viability, with some caution in the case of hotels. Water demand elasticity equals -0.38 in the case of hotels, but it is not significant in the case of restaurants and bar-cafes; hence, only in hotels is there potential for influencing water use patterns, encouraging the resource's conservation through pricing policy. Moreover, capital is a substitutive factor of water, and the elasticity of water with respect to output is 0.40, all of which should also be considered by policy makers in water resource management.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a systematic approach to the development of models for making hourly flow predictions, where each step provides insight into the relative importance of catchment and climatic properties (rainfall, soil properties, vegetation, topography), their spatial variability, and their influence on temporal flow variability at the outlet. Our modelling approach uses a simple conceptual model design requiring minimal calibration and physically meaningful input parameters estimated a priori from landscape data or from analyses of streamflow recession curves. The model structure allows direct measurement of parameter uncertainty and the ability to investigate its propagation through the model to produce bounds of predictive uncertainty via the Monte Carlo method. This method was applied to a number of model designs to assess the tradeoff between model complexity, accuracy and predictive uncertainty, and to identify the most appropriate model design under specific climatic conditions. With the preferred model, sensitivity analysis was used to identify the dominant controls on streamflow variability at the hourly timescale. In summary the aim is not to present a distributed model of universal applicability, but to generate insights into the climate, soil and vegetation controls on streamflow variability at the hourly timescale, and on predictive accuracy and uncertainty, that can be used in future modelling efforts.},

Starting with a short glimps of Taguchi’s robust design methodology, a detailed survey of approaches to robust optimization is presented. This includes a detailed discussion on how to account for design uncertainties and how to measure robustness (i.e., how to evaluate robustness). The main focus will be on the different approaches to perform robust optimization in practice including the methods of mathematical programming, deterministic nonlinear optimization, and direct search methods such as stochastic approximation and evolutionary computation. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods, thus, providing a basis for guiding the engineer to the most appropriate techniques. It also addresses performance aspects and test scenarios for direct robust optimization techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a risk-based approach for incorporating nonstationary probabilistic climate projections into long-term water resources planning. The proposed methodology uses nonstationary synthetic time series of future climates obtained via a stochastic weather generator based on the {UK} Climate Projections ({UKCP}09) to construct a probability distribution of the frequency of water shortages in the future. The {UKCP}09 projections extend well beyond the range of current hydrological variability, providing the basis for testing the robustness of water resources management plans to future climate-related uncertainties. The nonstationary nature of the projections combined with the stochastic simulation approach allows for extensive sampling of climatic variability conditioned on climate model outputs. The probability of exceeding planned frequencies of water shortages of varying severity (defined as Levels of Service for the water supply utility company) is used as a risk metric for water resources planning. Different sources of uncertainty, including demand-side uncertainties, are considered simultaneously and their impact on the risk metric is evaluated. Supply-side and demand-side management strategies can be compared based on how cost-effective they are at reducing risks to acceptable levels. A case study based on a water supply system in London ({UK}) is presented to illustrate the methodology. Results indicate an increase in the probability of exceeding the planned Levels of Service across the planning horizon. Under a 1\% per annum population growth scenario, the probability of exceeding the planned Levels of Service is as high as 0.5 by 2040. The case study also illustrates how a combination of supply and demand management options may be required to reduce the risk of water shortages.},

In this study, we present a methodology to separate uncertainties arising from the climate model ({CM}), the statistical postprocessing ({PP}) scheme, and the hydrological model ({HM}). We analyzed ensemble projections of hydrological changes in the Alpine Rhine (Eastern Switzerland) for the near-term and far-term scenario periods 2024–2050 and 2073–2099 with respect to 1964–1990. For the latter scenario period, the model ensemble projects a decrease of daily mean runoff in summer (−32.2\%, range [−45.5\% to −8.1\%]) and an increase in winter (+41.8\%, range [+4.8\% to +81.7\%]). We applied an analysis of variance model combined with a subsampling procedure to assess the importance of different uncertainty sources. The {CMs} generally are the dominant source in summer and autumn, whereas, in winter and spring, the uncertainties due to the {HMs} and the statistical {PP} gain importance and even partly dominate. In addition, results show that the individual uncertainties from the three components are not additive. Rather, the associated interactions among the {CM}, the statistical {PP} scheme, and the {HM} account for about 5\%–40\% of the total ensemble uncertainty. The results indicate, in distinction to some previous studies, that none of the investigated uncertainty sources are negligible, and some of the uncertainty is not attributable to individual modeling chain components but rather depends upon interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {The article advances the hypothesis that the seasonal and inter-annual variability of rainfall is a significant and measurable factor in the economic development of nations. An analysis of global datasets reveals a statistically significant relationship between greater rainfall variability and lower per capita {GDP.} Having established this correlation, we construct a water resources development index that highlights areas that have the greatest need for storage infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of rainfall variability on water availability for food and basic livelihood. The countries with the most critical infrastructure needs according to this metric are among the poorest in the world, and the majority of them are located in Africa. The importance of securing water availability in these nations increases every day in light of current population growth, economic development, and climate change projections.},

Journal of the American Water Resources Association ({JAWRA}) 47(3):524-534. {DOI}: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00552.x Abstract:  In this paper, we present a risk analysis and management process designed for use in water resources planning and management under climate change. The process incorporates climate information through a method called decision-scaling, whereby information related to climate projections is tailored for use in a decision-analytic framework. The climate risk management process begins with the identification of vulnerabilities by asking stakeholders and resource experts what water conditions they could cope with and which would require substantial policy or investment shifts. The identified vulnerabilities and thresholds are formalized with a water resources systems model that relates changes in the physical climate conditions to the performance metrics corresponding to vulnerabilities. The irreducible uncertainty of climate change projections is addressed through a dynamic management plan embedded within an adaptive management process. Implementation of the process is described as applied in the ongoing International Upper Great Lakes Study.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel method is presented for conditioning rainfall-runoff models for ungauged catchment and land use impact applications. The method conditions the model on information from multiple regionalized response indices using a formal Bayesian approach. Two indices that hold information about soil type and land use effects are the base flow index from the Hydrology of Soil Type ({HOST)} classification and curve number from the {U.S.} Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service soil and land use classification. These indices are used to constrain a five-parameter probability distributed moisture model for subcatchments of the Wye (grazed grassland) and Severn (mainly afforested) catchments in the United Kingdom. The base flow index and curve number constrain only two of the five model parameters, indicating that ideally, other sources of information would be sought. Nevertheless, the procedure significantly reduces the prior uncertainty in runoff prediction and gives predictions close to those of the calibrated models. For the case study, the introduction of the curve number in addition to the base flow index has only a small effect on model performance and uncertainty; however, it allows a distinction between the effects of soil type and land management for the purpose of scenario analysis. The principal assumptions used in the method are the applicability of the curve number classification system and its mapping to {UK} soil types and the likelihood function used for Bayesian conditioning.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed.
In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples.
The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide ({DMS)}, a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified.},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT:} Despite potential benefits for resource planning, community water systems managers have not used seasonal climate forecasts extensively. Obstacles to forecast use include a lack of awareness of their existence, distrust of their accuracy, perceived irrelevance to management decisions, and competition from other technological innovations. In this paper, ways in which seasonal forecasts might be extended to address more directly some concerns of South Carolina community water systems managers are explored. From May 1998 through August 2002, this group experienced drought conditions that threatened water quality and supply and required restrictions on water consumption. Methods for incorporating long lead forecasts with joint probabilities of monthly temperature and precipitation to produce drought forecasts are demonstrated. When tailored to specific places, such forecasts show the likelihood of exceeding drought thresholds that would trigger water use restrictions. The methods illustrate how long lead forecasts can be extended and customized into secondary products that address issues of greater relevance to water resource managers.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent deployment of the {NEXRAD} ({WSR-88D)} radars in the United States has made spatially distributed rainfall data available in an operational environment. In addition, national databases now exist with high-resolution digital terrain-elevation, soils, and land-use and land-cover data. The availability of such spatially distributed data brings into focus the question of the utility of hydrologic models with spatially distributed parameters and input in an operational environment. Are the data and models accurate and reliable enough to allow their use in an operational environment? The present study discusses a methodology for addressing this issue based on a sensitivity analysis of event streamflow to parameter and radar input within a Monte Carlo framework for the Illinois River basin in Oklahoma and Arkansas. This framework allows the incorporation of parametric and radar-rainfall uncertainties in the analysis and illustrates their effects on the results of the sensitivity. The particular distributed model used incorporates components that are adaptations of operational models used often in a spatially-lumped manner to produce estimates of soil water, runoff and streamflow in watersheds with an area of order 103 km2. A {GIS} is used to sub-divide the study watershed into small sub-catchment units with areas of a few hundred square kilometers. Soil water accounting and channel routing models are used to generate runoff and streamflow over the network of sub-catchments and streams. Spatially-distributed soil databases are used to condition relevant soil--water model parameters to reflect the soil field capacity. The main conclusions are that: (a) the distributed model forced by {NEXRAD} data produces results comparable to those produced by the operational spatially-lumped models using raingauge data; (b) sensitivity of flow statistics on various spatial scales to parameters and radar-rainfall input that are uncertain is scale dependent; and (c) in view of parametric and input uncertainty, in several cases, a spatially lumped model has response that cannot be statistically distinguished from that of the distributed model. This study is an initial step toward understanding the issues surrounding the use of distributed models in an operational environment. Repeating the sensitivity analysis for other areas with different geomorphologic, soils and climate characteristics is necessary to investigate aspects pertaining to higher variability in soils and terrain elevation, and the presence of snow accumulation and melt. Sensitivity analysis of soil water estimates to parameters and radar rainfall input is also a natural extension of this work.},

  Abstract                 = {The daily rainfall--runoff model, {MODHYDROLOG}, has been used extensively in Australia to estimate runoff from rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data. This paper describes the application of {MODHYDROLOG} to 28 catchments throughout Australia with different climatic and physical characteristics. Four simulations are carried out on each catchment, the simulations differing in the numbers of model parameters optimized in the model calibration. The study indicates that the use of nine (or fewer) model parameters is sufficient to give adequate estimates of streamflow, and the use of four or five parameters may be sufficient in temperate catchments and in applications where only approximate estimates of runoff are required. {MODHYDROLOG} is purported to be {\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\AA}{\textquotedblleft}physically based{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{\i}}{\textquestiondown}$\sfrac{1}{2}$ and this study also indicates that certain model parameters can be related to the catchment characteristics. However, it is difficult to estimate the values of some of the {\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\AA}{\textquotedblleft}important{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{\i}}{\textquestiondown}$\sfrac{1}{2}$ parameters, and for this reason, {MODHYDROLOG} must always be calibrated in all modelling applications. Based on the general results from this study, recommendations are given in the Appendix to guide model users in optimizing and determining parameter values in {MODHYDROLOG.}},

  Abstract                 = {Terms are defined that are frequently used (and misused) where mathematical models are applied to solve hydrological problems, and some of the many available models are classified into four main groups. It is suggested that models with parameters estimated by computing the minimum of a least--squares objective function represent an application of well--known non--linear regression theory to situations in which the assumptions commonly made in this theory are seldom valid. The correction required is not the use of objective functions other than those based on sums of squares, but the use of more realistic assumptions concerning the stochastic structure of the model residuals. Interdependence between model parameters necessitates extensive exploration of the sum--of--squares surface in the neighbourhood of its minimum even when regression assumptions are valid: this is particularly true where the model is to be used to examine the likely effects of a proposed physical change to the catchment, since the complexity of such a change will not generally be represented by a change in one (or even some) of the model's parameters, regardless of the remainder.},

Two major demographic uncertainties in the next 50 years concern international migration and the structure of families. Economies, nonhuman environments, and cultures (including values, religions, and politics) strongly influence demographic changes. Hence, human choices, individual and collective, will have demographic effects, intentional or otherwise.},

If elevated aridity in the western United States is a natural response to climate warming, then any trend toward warmer temperatures in the future could lead to a serious long--term increase in aridity over western North America.}

  Abstract                 = {A method has been developed to investigate the sensitivity of the solutions of large sets of coupled nonlinear rate equations to uncertainties in the rate coefficients. This method is based on varying all the rate coefficients simultaneously through the introduction of a parameter in such a way that the output concentrations become periodic functions of this parameter at any given time t. The concentrations of the chemical species are then Fourier analyzed at time t. We show via an application of Weyl's ergodic theorem that a subset of the Fourier coefficients is related to {\~{A}}{\pounds}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{E}}{\dag}{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\"{E}}{\dag}{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\v{s}}ci{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\"{E}}{\dag}{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textcent}{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\"{E}}{\dag}{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\v{s}}kl{\~{A}}{\pounds}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\^{a}}{\texteuro}$\deg$, the rate of change of the concentration of species i with respect to the rate constant for reaction l averaged over the uncertainties of all the other rate coefficients. Thus a large Fourier coefficient corresponds to a large sensitivity, and a small Fourier coefficient corresponds to a small sensitivity. The amount of numerical integration required to calculate these Fourier coefficients is considerably less than that required in tests of sensitivity where one varies one rate coefficient at a time, while holding all others fixed. The Fourier method developed in this paper is not limited to chemical rate equations, but can be applied to the study of the sensitivity of any large system of coupled, nonlinear differential equations with respect to the uncertainties in the modeling parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the sensitivity analysis of a well-known in-stream water quality model, {QUESTOR} ({QUality} Evaluation and Simulation {TOol} for River systems) as applied to two rivers of contrasting land-use in the northeast of England: the {\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{E}}{\oe}rural{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\^{a}}{\quotedblbase}{\textcent} Ouse and the {\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{E}}{\oe}urban{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\^{a}}{\quotedblbase}{\textcent} Aire. The analysis employed a version of the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test ({FAST)} that quantifies the contribution of changes in individual parameters and combination of parameters to the variance of the model output (here the {Nash--Sutcliffe)} in an efficient way. The quantification of the sensitivity of the model output to the parameters led to the identification of the most influential parameters. Differences between the Aire and the Ouse were found, reflecting their different water quality regime. Results highlighted the importance of interactions between two, or more, parameters on the model output. It led to question the one-at-a-time calibration method currently applied with {QUESTOR} and underlined the importance of including interactions between parameters in sensitivity analyses. Comparison of the relative influence of parameters versus input data showed contrasting results. In the urban system, the inputs from discharges (sewage treatment works and industrial effluents) were highly influential on model outputs and generally more important than the model parameters. For the rural river, the tributary discharges were most influential, but only at a similar or a lower level than the model parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainty in future climate change presents a key challenge for adaptation planning. In this study, uncertainty arising from internal climate variability is investigated using a new 40-member ensemble conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version 3 ({CCSM}3) under the {SRES} A1B greenhouse gas and ozone recovery forcing scenarios during 2000–2060. The contribution of intrinsic atmospheric variability to the total uncertainty is further examined using a 10,000-year control integration of the atmospheric model component of {CCSM}3 under fixed boundary conditions. The global climate response is characterized in terms of air temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure during winter and summer. The dominant source of uncertainty in the simulated climate response at middle and high latitudes is internal atmospheric variability associated with the annular modes of circulation variability. Coupled ocean-atmosphere variability plays a dominant role in the tropics, with attendant effects at higher latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections. Uncertainties in the forced response are generally larger for sea level pressure than precipitation, and smallest for air temperature. Accordingly, forced changes in air temperature can be detected earlier and with fewer ensemble members than those in atmospheric circulation and precipitation. Implications of the results for detection and attribution of observed climate change and for multi-model climate assessments are discussed. Internal variability is estimated to account for at least half of the inter-model spread in projected climate trends during 2005–2060 in the {CMIP}3 multi-model ensemble.},

  Abstract                 = {Projections of future climate change are plagued with uncertainties, causing difficulties for planners taking decisions on adaptation measures. This paper presents an assessment framework that allows the identification of adaptation strategies that are robust (i.e. insensitive) to climate change uncertainties. The framework is applied to a case study of water resources management in the East of England, more specifically to the Anglian Water Services’ 25 year Water Resource Plan ({WRP}). The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis (a ‘one-at-a-time’ experiment) of the various elements of the modelling framework (e.g., emissions of greenhouse gases, climate sensitivity and global climate models) in order to determine whether or not a decision to adapt to climate change is sensitive to uncertainty in those elements.

Water resources are found to be sensitive to uncertainties in regional climate response (from general circulation models and dynamical downscaling), in climate sensitivity and in climate impacts. Aerosol forcing and greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties are also important, whereas uncertainties from ocean mixing and the carbon cycle are not. Despite these large uncertainties, Anglian Water Services’ {WRP} remains robust to the climate change uncertainties sampled because of the adaptation options being considered (e.g. extension of water treatment works), because the climate model used for their planning ({HadCM}3) predicts drier conditions than other models, and because ‘one-at-a-time’ experiments do not sample the combination of different extremes in the uncertainty range of parameters. This research raises the question of how much certainty is required in climate change projections to justify investment in adaptation measures, and whether such certainty can be delivered.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Estimating the likelihood of future climate change has become a priority objective within the research community. This is the case because of the advancement of science, because of user demand and because of the central role played by climate prediction in guiding adaptation policy. But are probabilities what climate policy really needs? This article reviews three key questions: (1) Why might we (not) need probabilities of climate change? (2) What are the problems in estimating probabilities? (3) How are researchers estimating probabilities? These questions are analysed within the context of adaptation to climate change. Overall, we conclude that the jury is still out on whether probabilities are useful for climate adaptation policy. The answer is highly context dependent and thus is a function of the goals and motivation of the policy analysis, the unit of analysis, timescale and the training of the analyst. Probability assessment in the context of climate change is always subjective, conditional and provisional. There are various problems in estimating the probability of future climate change, but reflexive human behaviour (i.e. actions explicitly influenced by information) is largely intractable in the context of prediction. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope to develop novel methodologies that combine conditional probabilities with scenarios and which are relevant for climate decision-making.},

  Abstract                 = {Many studies have investigated potential climate change impacts on regional hydrology; less attention has been given to the components of uncertainty that affect these scenarios. This study quantifies uncertainties resulting from (i) General Circulation Models ({GCMs}), (ii) Regional Climate Models ({RCMs}), (iii) bias-correction of {RCMs}, and (iv) hydrological model parameterization using a multi-model framework. This consists of three {GCMs}, three {RCMs}, three bias-correction techniques, and sets of hydrological model parameters. The study is performed for the Lech watershed ({\textasciitilde} 1000 km2), located in the Northern Limestone Alps, Austria. Bias-corrected climate data are used to drive the hydrological model {HQsim} to simulate runoff under present (1971–2000) and future (2070–2099) climate conditions. Hydrological model parameter uncertainty is assessed by Monte Carlo sampling. The model chain is found to perform well under present climate conditions. However, hydrological projections are associated with high uncertainty, mainly due to the choice of {GCM} and {RCM}. Uncertainty due to bias-correction is found to have greatest influence on projections of extreme river flows, and the choice of method(s) is an important consideration in snowmelt systems. Overall, hydrological model parameterization is least important. The study also demonstrates how an improved understanding of the physical processes governing future river flows can help focus attention on the scientifically tractable elements of the uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {In systems biology, a common approach to model biological processes is to use large systems of nonlinear differential equations. The associated parameter estimation problem then requires a prior handling of the global identifiability question in a realistic experimental framework. The lack of a method able to solve this issue has indirectly encouraged the use of global sensitivity analysis to select the subset of parameters to estimate. Nevertheless, the links between these two global analyses are not yet fully explored.

The present work reveals new bridges between sensitivity analyses and global non-identifiability, through the use of functions derived from the Sobol’ high dimensional representation of the model output. We particularly specify limits of variance-based sensitivity tools to completely conclude on global non-identifiability of parameters in a given experimental context.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of nonlinear parameter estimation techniques is now commonplace in ground water model calibration. However, there is still ample room for further development of these techniques in order to enable them to extract more information from calibration datasets, to more thoroughly explore the uncertainty associated with model predictions, and to make them easier to implement in various modeling contexts. This paper describes the use of "pilot points" as a methodology for spatial hydraulic property characterization. When used in conjunction with nonlinear parameter estimation software that incorporates advanced regularization functionality (such as {PEST)}, use of pilot points can add a great deal of flexibility to the calibration process at the same time as it makes this process easier to implement. Pilot points can be used either as a substitute for zones of piecewise parameter uniformity, or in conjunction with such zones. In either case, they allow the disposition of areas of high and low hydraulic property value to be inferred through the calibration process, without the need for the modeler to guess the geometry of such areas prior to estimating the parameters that pertain to them. Pilot points and regularization can also be used as an adjunct to geostatistically based stochastic parameterization methods. Using the techniques described herein, a series of hydraulic property fields can be generated, all of which recognize the stochastic characterization of an area at the same time that they satisfy the constraints imposed on hydraulic property values by the need to ensure that model outputs match field measurements. Model predictions can then be made using all of these fields as a mechanism for exploring predictive uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {Current perspectives on global climate change based on recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) are presented. Impacts of a greenhouse warming that are likely to affect water planning and evaluation include changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, sea level rise, land use and population shifts following from these effects, and changes in water demands. Irrigation water demands are particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels. Despite recent advances in climate change science, great uncertainty remains as to how and when climate will change and how these changes will affect the supply and demand for water at the river basin and watershed levels, which are of most interest to planners. To place the climate-induced uncertainties in perspective, the influence on the supply and demand for water of non-climate factors such as population, technology, economic conditions, social and political factors, and the values society places on alternative water uses are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Input Variable Selection ({IVS}) is an essential step in the development of data-driven models and is particularly relevant in environmental modelling. While new methods for identifying important model inputs continue to emerge, each has its own advantages and limitations and no single method is best suited to all datasets and modelling purposes. Rigorous evaluation of new and existing input variable selection methods would allow the effectiveness of these algorithms to be properly identified in various circumstances. However, such evaluations are largely neglected due to the lack of guidelines or precedent to facilitate consistent and standardised assessment. In this paper, a new framework is proposed for the evaluation and inter-comparison of {IVS} methods which takes into account: (1) a wide range of dataset properties that are relevant to real world environmental data, (2) assessment criteria selected to highlight algorithm suitability in different situations of interest, and (3) a website for sharing data, algorithms and results (http://ivs4em.deib.polimi.it/). The framework is demonstrated on four {IVS} algorithms commonly used in environmental modelling studies and twenty-six datasets exhibiting different typical properties of environmental data. The main aim at this stage is to demonstrate the application of the proposed evaluation framework, rather than provide a definitive answer as to which of these algorithms has the best overall performance. Nevertheless, the results indicate interesting differences in the algorithms' performance that have not been identified previously.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a hierarchical systems model, which integrates a simulator of the mine water use process with a multi-objective optimiser for assessing mine water management strategies. The simulator advances prior tools in simulating complicated strategies by placing operation rules on model objects and process states. An optimisation framework that interacts with the simulator is used to identify optimal strategies for water storage, use and reuse that are ‘fit-for-purpose’, easy to handle, and economic. The model has been used to assess mine water use strategies in a coal mine in Queensland, Australia. The simulation results indicate that some tested strategies could reduce water use costs by more than 40\%, and raw water needed by more than 50\%. Further, the optimisation revealed more easy-to-handle strategies that could save more than 40\% of pipeline water and reduce the risks of penalties associated with discharge and of losing production due to insufficient water.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensitivity Analysis ({SA}) is able to identify the most influential parameters of a given model. Application of {SA} is usually critical for reducing the complexity in the subsequent model calibration and use. Unfortunately it is hardly applied, especially when the model is in the form of a computationally expensive black-box computer program. A possible solution concerns applying {SA} to the metamodel (i.e., an approximation of the computationally expensive model) instead. Among the other options, the use of Gaussian process metamodels (also known as Kriging metamodels) has been recently proposed for the {SA} of computationally expensive traffic simulation models. However, the main limitation of this approach is its dependence on the model dimensionality. When the model is high-dimensional, the estimation of the Kriging metamodel may still be problematic due to its high computational cost.

In order to overcome this problem, in the present paper, the Kriging-based approach has been combined with the quasi-Optimized Trajectory based Elementary Effects (quasi-{OTEE}) approach for the {SA} of high-dimensional models. The quasi-{OTEE} {SA} is used first to screen the influential and non-influential parameters of a high-dimensional model; then the Kriging-based {SA} is used to calculate the variance-based sensitivity indexes, and to rank the most influential parameters in a more accurate way. The application of the proposed sequential {SA} is illustrated with several numerical experiments. Results show that the method can properly identify the most influential parameters and their ranks, while the number of model evaluations is considerably less than the variance-based {SA} (e.g., in one of the tests the sequential {SA} requires over 50 times less model evaluations than the variance-based {SA}).},

  Abstract                 = {Despite recognition of the potential economic benefits and increasing interest in developing marketing instruments, water markets have remained thin and slow to evolve due to high transactions costs, third party effects, and the persistence of historical institutions for water allocation. Water banks are a marketing instrument that can address these obstacles to trade, allowing irrigators within a region to exchange water in order to mitigate the short-term effects of drought. Water banks coexist with the institutions governing water allocation, which implies that rule changes, such as adoption of a system of conjunctive surface water-groundwater administration, carry implications for the economic impacts of banking. This paper assesses and compares the welfare and distributional outcomes for irrigators in the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho under a suite of water management and drought scenarios. We find that water banking can offset irrigators' profit losses during drought, but that its ability to do so depends on whether it facilitates trade across groundwater and surface water users. With conjunctive administration, a bank allowing trade by source realizes 22.23\% of the maximum potential efficiency gains from trade during a severe drought, while a bank that allows trade across sources realizes 93.47\% of the maximum potential gains. During drought, conjunctive administration redistributes welfare from groundwater to surface water producers, but banking across sources allows groundwater irrigators to recover 88.4\% of the profits lost from drought at a cost of 2.2\% of the profit earned by surface water irrigators.},

  Abstract                 = {For 100 years, California’s State Water Resources Control Board and its predecessors have been responsible for allocating available water supplies to beneficial uses, but inaccurate and incomplete accounting of water rights has made the state ill-equipped to satisfy growing societal demands for water supply reliability and healthy ecosystems. Here, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of appropriative water rights to identify where, and to what extent, water has been dedicated to human uses relative to natural supplies. The results show that water right allocations total 400 billion cubic meters, approximately five times the state’s mean annual runoff. In the state’s major river basins, water rights account for up to 1000\% of natural surface water supplies, with the greatest degree of appropriation observed in tributaries to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and in coastal streams in southern California. Comparisons with water supplies and estimates of actual use indicate substantial uncertainty in how water rights are exercised. In arid regions such as California, over-allocation of surface water coupled with trends of decreasing supply suggest that new water demands will be met by re-allocation from existing uses. Without improvements to the water rights system, growing human and environmental demands portend an intensification of regional water scarcity and social conflict. California’s legal framework for managing its water resources is largely compatible with needed reforms, but additional public investment is required to enhance the capacity of the state’s water management institutions to effectively track and regulate water rights.},

  Abstract                 = {Over-parameterisation is a well-known and often described problem in hydrological models, especially for distributed models. Therefore, methods to reduce the number of parameters via sensitivity analysis are important for the efficient use of these models. This paper describes a novel sampling strategy that is a combination of latin-hypercube and one-factor-at-a-time sampling that allows a global sensitivity analysis for a long list of parameters with only a limited number of model runs. The method is illustrated with an application of the water flow and water quality parameters of the distributed water quality program {SWAT}, considering flow, suspended sediment, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate and ammonia outputs at several locations in the Upper North Bosque River catchment in Texas and the Sandusky River catchment in Ohio. The application indicates that the methodology works successfully. The results also show that hydrologic parameters are dominant in controlling water quality predictions. Finally, the sensitivity results are not transferable between basins and thus the analysis needs to be conducted separately for each study catchment.},

  Abstract                 = {{AbstractWith} hard-to-predict changes in future demand, climate, supply options, technological opportunities, and budgetary constraints, water agency plans should be flexible and robust, designed to meet agency goals over a wide range of plausible future conditions. But current state-of-the-art approaches to water planning make it difficult to craft flexible and robust plans to guide resource allocation and facilitate discussions with the agency’s constituents and ratepayers. This paper describes an innovative effort by one agency, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (termed Metropolitan), to begin to address these challenges. Metropolitan’s year 2010 integrated resources plan ({IRP}) update specifies resource allocations over 25 years and calls for an adaptive management approach to revisit these allocations over time. Using a quantitative decision support approach called robust decision-making ({RDM}), an enhanced version of Metropolitan’s main planning model was run, over many thousands of cases representing different combinations of assumptions about future demand, conditions in the bay/delta, climate conditions, local resource yields, and implementation challenges. Statistical cluster analysis on the resulting database of model runs identifies scenarios that succinctly summarize the types of future conditions in which the {IRP} core resources strategy does and does not meet its goals. These scenarios inform early warning indicators that can guide the adaptive management component of the {IRP}. The robust decision methods presented in this paper should prove broadly useful for Metropolitan in addition to other water agencies seeking to develop robust and adaptive plans in the face of uncertain future conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A new paradigm for planning under conditions of deep uncertainty has emerged in the literature. According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called ‘Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways’. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: ‘Adaptive Policymaking’ and ‘Adaptation Pathways’. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. ‘mitigating actions’ and ‘hedging actions’) and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Karst aquifers provide large parts of the water supply for Mediterranean countries, though climate change is expected to have a significant negative impact on water availability. Recharge is therefore a key variable that has to be known for sustainable groundwater use. In this study, we present a new approach that combines two independent methods for karst recharge estimation. The first method derives spatially distributed information of mean annual recharge patterns through {GIS} analysis. The second is a process-based karst model that provides spatially lumped but temporally distributed information about recharge. By combining both methods we add a spatial reference to the lumped simulations of the process-based model. In this way we are able to provide spatio-temporal information of recharge and subsurface flow dynamics also during varying hydro-climatic conditions. We find that there is a non-linear relationship between precipitation and recharge rates resulting in strong decreases of recharge following even moderate decreases of precipitation. This is primarily due to almost constant actual evapotranspiration amounts despite varying hydro-climatic conditions. During the driest year in the record, almost the entire precipitation was consumed as actual evapotranspiration and only little diffuse recharge took place at the high altitudes of our study site. During wettest year, recharge constituted a much larger fraction of precipitation and occurred at the entire study site. Our new method and our findings are significant for decision makers in similar regions that want to prepare for possible changes of hydro-climatic conditions in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {We separate and quantify the sources of uncertainty in projections of regional (∼2,500 km) precipitation changes for the twenty-first century using the {CMIP}3 multi-model ensemble, allowing a direct comparison with a similar analysis for regional temperature changes. For decadal means of seasonal mean precipitation, internal variability is the dominant uncertainty for predictions of the first decade everywhere, and for many regions until the third decade ahead. Model uncertainty is generally the dominant source of uncertainty for longer lead times. Scenario uncertainty is found to be small or negligible for all regions and lead times, apart from close to the poles at the end of the century. For the global mean, model uncertainty dominates at all lead times. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the precipitation projections is highest at the poles but less than 1 almost everywhere else, and is far lower than for temperature projections. In particular, the tropics have the highest S/N for temperature, but the lowest for precipitation. We also estimate a ‘potential S/N’ by assuming that model uncertainty could be reduced to zero, and show that, for regional precipitation, the gains in S/N are fairly modest, especially for predictions of the next few decades. This finding suggests that adaptation decisions will need to be made in the context of high uncertainty concerning regional changes in precipitation. The potential to narrow uncertainty in regional temperature projections is far greater. These conclusions on S/N are for the current generation of models; the real signal may be larger or smaller than the {CMIP}3 multi-model mean. Also note that the S/N for extreme precipitation, which is more relevant for many climate impacts, may be larger than for the seasonal mean precipitation considered here.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Faced by the realities of a changing climate, decision makers in a wide variety of organizations are increasingly seeking quantitative predictions of regional and local climate. An important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is what is the potential for climate science to deliver improvements—especially reductions in uncertainty—in such predictions? Uncertainty in climate predictions arises from three distinct sources: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Using data from a suite of climate models, we separate and quantify these sources. For predictions of changes in surface air temperature on decadal timescales and regional spatial scales, we show that uncertainty for the next few decades is dominated by sources (model uncertainty and internal variability) that are potentially reducible through progress in climate science. Furthermore, we find that model uncertainty is of greater importance than internal variability. Our findings have implications for managing adaptation to a changing climate. Because the costs of adaptation are very large, and greater uncertainty about future climate is likely to be associated with more expensive adaptation, reducing uncertainty in climate predictions is potentially of enormous economic value. We highlight the need for much more work to compare (a) the cost of various degrees of adaptation, given current levels of uncertainty and (b) the cost of new investments in climate science to reduce current levels of uncertainty. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting climate science investments on the most promising opportunities to reduce prediction uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this paper is to analyze the reliability of the Multi--step Automated Calibration Scheme ({MACS)} over a variety of climatic and hydrologic conditions. The authors developed {MACS} for the estimation of parameters for hydrologic models; be it for 'fine--tuning' of a priori estimates, or for estimating parameters without a priori knowledge of the system. Optimization methods have advanced over the last few decades, and although they are used extensively by the research community, operational hydrologists have been less eager to implement automated calibration procedures. The authors, under cooperative agreement with the National Weather Service ({NWS)} Hydrology Laboratory have collaborated to develop a progressive calibration strategy, using 'in--house' {NWS} algorithms to optimize parameters for the hydrologic models used in operational streamflow forecasting: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting ({SAC--SMA)} and the {SNOW--17} model. The method, though developed within the {NWS} forecasting system, can be easily adapted to any hydrologic modeling system. In our current work, {MACS} has been tested on 20 {NWS} forecast points (or basins), located in various hydrologic and climatic regimes (five different River Forecast Centers ({RFCs))} across the United States. Over half of the basins tested (11) consist of multi--tiered systems in the Western {US} (i.e. the hydrologic models are run over several elevation zones for one forecast point). The results show comparable, reliable calibrations, similar in quality to the traditional manual techniques, over all of the hydro--climatic regimes used for this study. {MACS}, generally, produces simulations with desirable performance measures, including improved {Nash--Sutcliffe} efficiency and lower percent bias. {MACS} performs well in all regions, even over the complex terrain in the western regions of the United States.

  Abstract                 = {Hydrological models frequently suffer from limited predictive power despite adequate calibration performances. This can indicate insufficient representations of the underlying processes. Thus ways are sought to increase model consistency while satisfying the contrasting priorities of increased model complexity and limited equifinality. In this study the value of a systematic use of hydrological signatures and expert knowledge for increasing model consistency was tested. It was found that a simple conceptual model, constrained by 4 calibration objective functions, was able to adequately reproduce the hydrograph in the calibration period. The model, however, could not reproduce 20 hydrological signatures, indicating a lack of model consistency. Subsequently, testing 11 models, model complexity was increased in a stepwise way and counter-balanced by “prior constraints”, inferred from expert knowledge to ensure a model which behaves well with respect to the modeller’s perception of the system. We showed that, in spite of unchanged calibration performance, the most complex model set-up exhibited increased performance in the independent test period and skill to reproduce all 20 signatures, indicating a better system representation. The results suggest that a model may be inadequate despite good performance with respect to multiple calibration objectives and that increasing model complexity, if counter-balanced by prior constraints, can increase predictive performance of a model and its skill to reproduce hydrological signatures. The results strongly illustrate the need to balance automated model calibration with a more expert-knowledge driven strategy of constraining models.},

  Abstract                 = {A conceptual rainfall--runoff model was applied to 95 catchments in the Rhine basin for the purpose of modeling of the effect of land use change on the runoff. An approach to calibrate the model by associating the model parameters with the physical catchment characteristics was implemented. Land use, soil type, catchment size, and topographic structure were used as the bases for regionalization of the model parameters. Parameter values were initially associated with these catchment characteristics and were finally transferred into their catchment scale values using a transfer function, whose form was assumed a priori. A simultaneous model calibration was performed for a number of catchments with contrasting catchment characteristics. An optimization algorithm was used for the calibration with an objective function defined as the normalized sum of the squared differences between the modeled and the observed runoff. The regionalized model thus obtained was then used to model the resulting runoff for different land use scenarios generated in the model area. The results obtained suggest that increased urbanization leads to an increase in the lower peak runoff resulting from summer storm, while the increase in the higher peaks resulting from winter rainfall is very little. On the other hand, a considerable reduction of both the peak runoff and the total runoff volume resulted from intensified afforestation.},

  Abstract                 = {Allocating water to different uses implies trading off the benefits perceived by different sectors. This paper demonstrates how visualising the trade-offs implied by the best performing water management options helps balance water use benefits and find sustainable solutions. The approach consists of linking a water resources model that can simulate many management policies and track diverse measures of system performance, to a many-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithm. This generates the set of Pareto-optimal management alternatives for several simultaneous objectives. The relative performance of these efficient management alternatives is then visualised as trade-off curves or surfaces using visual analytic plots. Visually assessing trade-offs between benefits helps select policies that achieve a decision-maker-selected balance between different metrics of system performance. We apply this approach to a multi-reservoir water resource system in Brazil's semi-arid Jaguaribe basin where current water allocation procedures favour sectors with greater political power and technical knowledge. The case study identifies promising reservoir operating policies by exploring trade-offs between economic, ecological and livelihood benefits as well as traditional hydropower generation, irrigation and water supply. Results show optimised policies can increase allocations to downstream uses while increasing median land availability for the poorest farmers by 25\%.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter makes a review, in a complete methodological framework, of various global sensitivity analysis methods of model output. Numerous statistical and probabilistic tools (regression, smoothing, tests, statistical learning, Monte Carlo, {\textbackslash}ldots) aim at determining the model input variables which mostly contribute to an interest quantity depending on model output. This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable. Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most influential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application. A synthesis is given to place every method according to several axes, mainly the cost in number of model evaluations, the model complexity and the nature of brought information.},

  Abstract                 = {Though there are surprisingly few estimates of the economic benefits of coordinated infrastructure development and operations in international river basins, there is a widespread belief that improved cooperation is beneficial for managing water scarcity and variability. Hydro-economic optimization models are commonly-used for identifying efficient allocation of water across time and space, but such models typically assume full coordination. In the real world, investment and operational decisions for specific projects are often made without full consideration of potential downstream impacts. This paper describes a tractable methodology for evaluating the economic benefits of infrastructure coordination. We demonstrate its application over a range of water availability scenarios in a catchment of the Mekong located in Lao {PDR}, the Nam Ngum River Basin. Results from this basin suggest that coordination improves system net benefits from irrigation and hydropower by approximately 3–12\% (or {US}\$12-53 million/yr) assuming moderate levels of flood control, and that the magnitude of coordination benefits generally increases with the level of water availability and with inflow variability. Similar analyses would be useful for developing a systematic understanding of the factors that increase the costs of non-cooperation in river basin systems worldwide, and would likely help to improve targeting of efforts to stimulate complicated negotiations over water resources.},

  Abstract                 = {{AbstractLong}-range infrastructure planning is fraught with uncertainties. Population growth may occur faster or slower than expected, regulations may change, and public sentiment can shift. In the face of these uncertainties, water system managers must plan for large infrastructure investments and the questions about when it is desirable to invest in infrastructure and what is the appropriate infrastructure component size to meet growing demands. One of the most powerful and intuitive ways to incorporate uncertainties is to use scenarios that represent plausible futures. Scenario-based planning is gaining acceptance in the water resources community. Preparing for a range of possible futures provides flexibility and adds robustness to the system so it can respond to uncertain events at reasonable costs while maintaining community confidence in their utilities. In this paper, novel scenario-based planning and optimization approaches are presented for the optimal design of regional-scale water supply infrastructure in a multiperiod planning framework. For demonstration, water demand projections are considered as uncertain and multiperiod construction projects are selected to minimize the economic costs. The solution approaches are applied to a decentralized water reclamation planning project in a green-field development area in southeast Tucson, Arizona, where water reclamation is viewed as a potential component for a sustainable water supply.},

  Abstract                 = {{AbstractUncertainties} facing water planners and designers include changes in demand resulting from community growth (temporal and spatial), per capita water use, public perceptions, and regulations. One of the most powerful and intuitive ways to represent these uncertainties in the planning stage is to use scenarios. A scenario represents a realization of the system’s random parameters. Scenario-based analysis provides organizational flexibility by planning for multiple potential future scenarios, each of which may be, although is not necessarily, associated with a probability of occurrence. In this study, a scenario-based multiobjective optimization model for robust optimal design of regional-scale water and wastewater infrastructure is presented. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with an application to the planning of a decentralized water supply and reuse system for a new development area in metropolitan Tucson, where sustainable water supply is a significant issue.},

  Abstract                 = {{AbstractAttributes} of an effective infrastructure adaptation planning process as well as methods for choosing among adaptation strategies are described. The major attributes include: (1) a vulnerability assessment, (2) proactive adaptation strategies that are implemented over time and space, (3) climate change scenario analysis including climate surprises to handle the uncertainty of the future climate, (4) actions that are robust and/or flexible and adjustable, (5) a planned, progressive approach that ties implementation to critical thresholds of actual climate changes and preserves options for future actions, (6) evaluation with multiple social, economic and environmental criteria, and (7) integration of local stakeholders into the planning process. Multiple methods can be used to generate and evaluate adaptation strategies. A subset of the key attributes is then used in a case study of urban drainage management, which was designed and implemented to illustrate these attributes. It is shown that multicriteria scenario analysis can be effectively used to generate and evaluate alternative adaptation strategies. The identification of when critical thresholds are reached under conditions of climate variability and change is a major research need.},

  Abstract                 = {A new ensemble of climate models is becoming available and provides the basis for climate change projections. Here, we show a first analysis indicating that the models in the new ensemble agree better with observations than those in older ones and that the poorest models have been eliminated. Most models are strongly tied to their predecessors, and some also exchange ideas and code with other models, thus supporting an earlier hypothesis that the models in the new ensemble are neither independent of each other nor independent of the earlier generation. On the basis of one atmosphere model, we show how statistical methods can identify similarities between model versions and complement process understanding in characterizing how and why a model has changed. We argue that the interdependence of models complicates the interpretation of multimodel ensembles but largely goes unnoticed.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of impacts from anthropogenic climate change rely on projections from climate models. Uncertainties in those have often been a limiting factor, in particular on local scales. A new generation of more complex models running scenarios for the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report ({IPCC} {AR}5) is widely, and perhaps naively, expected to provide more detailed and more certain projections. Here we show that projected global temperature change from the new models is remarkably similar to that from those used in {IPCC} {AR}4 after accounting for the different underlying scenarios. The spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change are also very consistent. Interestingly, the local model spread has not changed much despite substantial model development and a massive increase in computational capacity. Part of this model spread is irreducible owing to internal variability in the climate system, yet there is also uncertainty from model differences that can potentially be eliminated. We argue that defining progress in climate modelling in terms of narrowing uncertainties is too limited. Models improve, representing more processes in greater detail. This implies greater confidence in their projections, but convergence may remain slow. The uncertainties should not stop decisions being made.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates an approach that combines physically-based and conceptual model features in two stages of distributed modeling: model structure development and estimation of spatially variable parameters. The approach adds more practicality to the process of model parameterization, and facilitates an easier transition from current lumped model-based operational systems to more powerful distributed systems. This combination of physically-based and conceptual model features is implemented within the Hydrology Laboratory Research Modeling System ({HL-RMS).} {HL-RMS} consists of a well-tested conceptual water balance model applied on a regular spatial grid linked to physically-based kinematic hillslope and channel routing models. Parameter estimation procedures that combine spatially distributed and {\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{E}}{\oe}integrated{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\^{a}}{\quotedblbase}{\textcent} basin-outlet properties have been developed for the water balance and routing components. High-resolution radar-based precipitation data over a large region are used in testing {HL-RMS.} Initial tests show that {HL-RMS} yields results comparable to well-calibrated lumped model simulations in several headwater basins, and it outperforms a lumped model in basins where spatial rainfall variability effects are significant. It is important to note that simulations for two nested basins (not calibrated directly, but parameters from the calibration of the parent basin were applied instead) outperformed lumped simulations even more consistently, which means that {HL-RMS} has the potential to improve the accuracy and resolution of river runoff forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel solution to the estimation of catchment rainfall at a sub-hourly resolution from measured streamflow is introduced and evaluated for two basins with markedly different flow pathways and rainfall regimes. It combines a continuous-time transfer function model with regularised derivative estimates obtained using a recursive method with capacity for handling missing data. The method has general implications for off-line estimation of unknown inputs as well as robust estimation of derivatives. It is compared with an existing approach using a range of model metrics, including residuals analysis and visuals; and is shown to recover the salient features of the observed, sub-hourly rainfall, sufficient to produce a precise estimate of streamflow, indistinguishable from the output of the catchment model in response to the observed rainfall data. Results indicate potential for use of this method in environment-related applications for periods lacking sub-hourly rainfall observations.},

The variance-based methods also known as Sobol’ sensitivity indices has become the method of choice among practitioners due to its efficiency and ease of interpretation. For complex practical problems, estimation of Sobol’ sensitivity indices generally requires a large number of function evaluations to achieve reasonable convergence. To improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo estimates for the Sobol’ total sensitivity indices we apply the control variate reduction technique and develop a new formula for evaluation of total sensitivity indices. Presented results using well known test functions show the efficiency of the developed technique.},

  Abstract                 = {Four catchment grouping methods are compared in terms of their performance in predicting specific low flow discharges q95, i.e. the specific discharge that is exceeded on 95\% of all days. The grouping methods are the residual pattern approach, weighted cluster analysis, regression trees and an approach based on seasonality regions. For each group, a regression model between catchment characteristics and q95 is fitted independently. Data from 325 sub--catchments in Austria ranging in catchment area from 7 to 963\&\#xa0;km2 are used in the analysis. The performance of the methods is assessed by leave--one--out cross--validation of the regressionestimates, which emulates the case of ungauged catchments. Results indicate that the grouping based on seasonality regions performs best and explains 70\% of the spatial variance of q95. The favourable performance of this grouping method is likely related to the striking differences in seasonal low flow processes in the study domain. Winter low flows are associated with the retention of solid precipitation in the seasonal snow pack while summer low flows are related to the relatively large moisture deficits in the lowland catchments during summer. The regression tree grouping performs second best (explained variance of 64\%) and the performance of the residual pattern approach is similar (explained variance of 63\%). The weighted cluster analysis only explains 59\% of the spatial variance of q95, which is only a minor improvement over the global regression model, i.e. without using any grouping (explained variance of 57\%). An analysis of the sample characteristics of all methods suggests that, again, the grouping method based on the seasonality regions has the most favourable characteristics although all methods tend to underestimate specific low flow discharges in the very wet catchments.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional water supply systems undergo surplus and deficit conditions due to differences in inflow characteristics as well as due to their seasonal demand patterns. This study proposes a framework for regional water management by proposing an interbasin transfer ({IBT}) model that uses climate-information-based inflow forecast for minimizing the deviations from the end-of-season target storage across the participating pools. Using the ensemble streamflow forecast, the {IBT} water allocation model was applied for two reservoir systems in the North Carolina Triangle Area. Results show that interbasin transfers initiated by the ensemble streamflow forecast could potentially improve the overall water supply reliability as the demand continues to grow in the Triangle Area. To further understand the utility of climate forecasts in facilitating {IBT} under different spatial correlation structures between inflows and between the initial storages of the two systems, a synthetic experiment was designed to evaluate the framework under inflow forecast having different skills. Findings from the synthetic study can be summarized as follows: (a) inflow forecasts combined with the proposed {IBT} optimization model provide improved allocation in comparison to the allocations obtained under the no-transfer scenario as well as under transfers obtained with climatology; (b) spatial correlations between inflows and between initial storages among participating reservoirs could also influence the potential benefits that could be achieved through {IBT}; (c) {IBT} is particularly beneficial for systems that experience low correlations between inflows or between initial storages or on both attributes of the regional water supply system. Thus, if both infrastructure and permitting structures exist for promoting interbasin transfers, season-ahead inflow forecasts could provide added benefits in forecasting surplus/deficit conditions among the participating pools in the regional water supply system.},

  Abstract                 = {With the objective of studying conceptual rainfall--runoff modelling performance in different climates, the {HBV--96} model was applied on four catchments located in Europe, Africa and South America. Manual, automatic and Monte Carlo techniques were used for model calibration and parameter analyses. It was found that the magnitude of the water balance components had a significant influence on model performance. Performance decreased and demands of calibration period length increased with increased catchment dryness primarily because of a neater water balance and higher climatic variability in drier areas. A large degree of equifinality was discovered in all catchments where different calibration methods yielded equally good results but with different parameter combinations. Thus, it may be impossible to know if an optimum parameter set exists and to relate parameter values to physical properties of the catchment. On the other hand the validation results indicated that it might not matter if parameter values were not unique when studying runoff solely, provided the model application is within the same regime of flows.},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT}: Among the many concerns associated with global climate change, the potential effects on water resources are frequently cited as the most worrisome. In contrast, those who manage water resources do not rate climatic change among their top planning and operational concerns. The difference in these views can be associated with how water managers operate their systems and the types of stresses, and the operative time horizons, that affect the Nation's water resources infrastructure. Climate, or more precisely weather, is an important variable in the management of water resources at daily to monthly time scales because water resources systems generally are operated on a daily basis. At decadal to centennial time scales, though, climate is much less important because (1) forecasts, particularly of regional precipitation, are extremely uncertain over such time periods, and (2) the magnitude of effects due to changes in climate on water resources is small relative to changes in other variables such as population, technology, economics, and environmental regulation. Thus, water management agencies find it difficult to justify changing design features or operating rules on the basis of simulated climatic change at the present time, especially given that reservoir-design criteria incorporate considerable buffering capacity for extreme meteorological and hydro-logical events.},

  Abstract                 = {Global sensitivity analysis of complex numerical models can be performed by calculating variance-based importance measures of the input variables, such as the Sobol indices. However, these techniques, requiring a large number of model evaluations, are often unacceptable for time expensive computer codes. A well-known and widely used decision consists in replacing the computer code by a metamodel, predicting the model responses with a negligible computation time and rending straightforward the estimation of Sobol indices. In this paper, we discuss about the Gaussian process model which gives analytical expressions of Sobol indices. Two approaches are studied to compute the Sobol indices: the first based on the predictor of the Gaussian process model and the second based on the global stochastic process model. Comparisons between the two estimates, made on analytical examples, show the superiority of the second approach in terms of convergence and robustness. Moreover, the second approach allows to integrate the modeling error of the Gaussian process model by directly giving some confidence intervals on the Sobol indices. These techniques are finally applied to a real case of hydrogeological modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {Planning appropriate portfolios of new water supplies and demand management measures requires considering a wide array of options and their interactions over a largely unknown future. Various modelling-assisted approaches are available to help this planning process. This paper applies two such frameworks to the {UK}’s Thames water resource system and compares their methods and outputs: how they consider uncertainty, how they represent supply and demand management options, and what plans each recommends. The first method is the current England and Wales industry standard: annual least-cost capacity expansion optimisation over a 25 to 30 year time horizon considering capital, operating (fixed and variable), social and environmental costs. The second approach uses stochastic simulation and regret analysis to select a preferred alternative, then statistical cluster analysis to identify causes of system failure enabling further plan improvement. When applied iteratively with system planners this second approach is referred to as Robust Decision Making ({RDM}). The economic optimisation approach considers all plausible combinations of supply and conservation schemes and recommends the least-cost schedule of their implementation. Our {RDM} application considers a smaller number of options but makes a more detailed assessment of the effect of uncertainty (supply, demand and energy price uncertainty were considered) on multiple criteria of system performance. The simulation-based approach also enables more realistic interaction amongst supply and demand management schemes. Both approaches recommended different plans which we explain by discussing the benefits and limitations of each. Joint application is recommended to produce least-cost plans that are robust considering multiple criteria of performance across a wide range of futures.},

  Abstract                 = {In most multi-objective optimization problems we aim at selecting the most preferred among the generated Pareto optimal solutions (a subjective selection among objectively determined solutions). In this paper we consider the robustness of the selected Pareto optimal solution in relation to perturbations within weights of the objective functions. For this task we design an integrated approach that can be used in multi-objective discrete and continuous problems using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and optimization. In the proposed method we introduce measures of robustness for Pareto optimal solutions. In this way we can compare them according to their robustness, introducing one more characteristic for the Pareto optimal solution quality. In addition, especially in multi-objective discrete problems, we can detect the most robust Pareto optimal solution among neighboring ones. A computational experiment is designed in order to illustrate the method and its advantages. It is noteworthy that the Augmented Weighted Tchebycheff proved to be much more reliable than the conventional weighted sum method in discrete problems, due to the existence of unsupported Pareto optimal solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensitivity is a measure of the effect of change in one factor on another factor. Sensitivity analysis is potentially useful in all phases of the modeling process: model formulation, model calibration and model verification. The sensitivity of model parameters should be recognized as a special case of the above general definition. Parametric sensitivity is a vital part of most optimization techniques. However, other facets of sensitivity need to be recognized. The time--dependent nature of sensitivity should be considered in the formulation of hydrologic models. A variety of simplified hydrologic models are used to demonstrate the potential of sensitivity in all phases of the modeling process. The failure to recognize and exploit the potential of sensitivity analysis results primarily from the inadequacy of the mathematical foundations of sensitivity. A comprehensive mathematical framework of sensitivity is provided and additional research needs are identified.},

  Abstract                 = {We simulate the water balance dynamics of 308 catchments in Austria using a lumped conceptual model involving 11 calibration parameters. We calibrate and verify the model for two non--overlapping 11--year periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating that they are able to represent the regional or large--scale differences in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some of the spatial parameter variability with coefficients of determination of up to R2=0.27, but usually the R2 values are lower. Parameter uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated parameters and catchment attributes to a significant extent as suggested by an optimised correlation analysis. The median {Nash--Sutcliffe} efficiencies of simulating streamflow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63 when moving from the calibration to the verification period. This is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with over--parameterisation of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream (nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration period, the average decrease in the {Nash--Sutcliffe} model efficiency, as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice the decrease of moving from the calibration to the verification period. The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes perform significantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment attributes.},

  Abstract                 = {Engineering design generally involves two, possibly integrated, phases: (i) generating design options, and (ii) choosing the most satisfactory option on the basis of some determined criteria. The depth, or lack, of integration between these two phases defines different design approaches, and differing philosophical views from the part of researchers in the field of computational design. Optimization-Based Design ({OBD}) covers the spectrum of this depth of integration. While most {OBD} approaches strongly integrate these two phases, some employ computational optimization only in the first or second phase. Regardless of where a method or researcher lies in this philosophical spectrum, some requisite characteristics are fundamental to the effectiveness of {OBD} methods. In particular, (i) the Aggregate Objective Function ({AOF}) used in the optimization must have the ability to generate all Pareto solutions, (ii) the generation of any existing Pareto solutions must be possible with reasonable ease, and (iii) even changes in the {AOF} parameters should yield a well distributed set of Pareto solutions. This paper examines the effectiveness of physical programming ({PP}) with respect to the latter, yielding favorable conclusions. Previous papers have led to similarly positive conclusions with respect to the former two. This paper also presents a comparative study featuring {PP} and other popular methods, where {PP} is shown to perform favorably. A {PP}-based method for generating the Pareto frontier is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The Hydrology Lab ({HL)} of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service ({NOAA/NWS)}, Office of Hydrologic Development ({OHD)} is currently developing and testing the {HL} Research Modeling System ({HL-RMS).} Currently, the system has one snow model ({SNOW-17)} and two runoff models: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting ({SAC-SMA)} and the Continuous Antecedent Precipitation Index ({CONT-API).} The {NWS} lumped {CONT-API} model is operational in one of the {NWS} River Forecasting Centers ({RFCs)}, the Middle Atlantic {RFC} ({MARFC)} in the United States. This study deals with the derivation of a priori distributed parameters for the {CONT-API} model. In our strategy, initial distributed parameters based on the calibrated lumped {CONT-API} parameters of 67 basins in the Susquehanna River Basin are derived. This study shows that the {CONT-API} model six-hourly calibrated parameters can be used in an one-hourly lumped model with only minor changes in total runoff volume (less than 5\%). However, to obtain the timing of simulated hydrographs, appropriate one-hourly unit hydrographs need to be derived. A priori-distributed model parameters were based on relationships between soil properties and calibrated lumped {CONT-API} parameters. Multiple linear regressions with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.39 to 0.63 were obtained for 10 lumped model parameters. Using these predicted parameters, the lumped model produced simulations having {Nash--Sutcliffe} efficiency, Neff, statistics ranging from 0.69 to 0.78 for five of the 67 basins. These are commensurate with goodness-of-fit statistics from lumped model calibrations. Furthermore, application of the method in deriving a priori parameters gave a promising result in distributed model simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {A computational model is a representation of some physical or other system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earth’s climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences. The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.},

  Abstract                 = {Scientists and others from academia, government, and the private sector increasingly are using climate model outputs in research and decision support. For the most recent assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 18 global modeling centers contributed outputs from hundreds of simulations, coordinated through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 ({CMIP}3), to the archive at the Program for Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison ({PCMDI}; http://pcmdi3.llnl.gov) [Meehl et al., 2007]. Many users of climate model outputs prefer downscaled data—i.e., data at higher spatial resolution—to direct global climate model ({GCM}) outputs; downscaling can be statistical [e.g., Meehl et al., 2007] or dynamical [e.g., Mearns et al., 2009]. More than 800 users have obtained downscaled {CMIP}3 results from one such Web site alone (see http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled cmip3\_projections/, described by Meehl et al., [2007]).},

  Abstract                 = {The Canadian Rocky Mountain headwaters support the water resource systems of the Canadian Prairies. Significant variations in natural headwater contributions have been observed due to warming climate. Projecting future natural headwater flows under climate change effects, however, has large uncertainty. First, there are difficulties in climate modeling and downscaling in alpine regions. Second, streamflow modeling in mountainous areas is extremely challenging. There is therefore a need to understand the effects of uncertainty in the natural inflow regime, and in particular how this translates into uncertainty in representing the state and the outflow of water resource systems. Considering the Oldman River basin in Alberta, Canada, we synthesized different inflow regimes based on site/inter-site properties of the historical inflow regime. The water resources system was then conditioned on the synthesized inflow regimes to identify the mechanisms of error propagation from the headwater streamflows to the water allocations. The results show that the response of the water resource system to the uncertainty in the generated inflow regime depends on the system state, flow condition and the component of interest. Generally, the response of the reservoirs to the uncertainty in the estimated inflow regime is more significant in dry years, in particular during low flow conditions. The response at the system outlet is rather different, as the propagation of the headwater uncertainty is more significant during high flow conditions. Also, similar inflow estimates in terms of error and uncertainty may result in different error and uncertainty estimates in the simulated outflows; therefore, lower bias and uncertainty in estimating the regional inflow regime does not necessarily mean lower bias and uncertainty in simulating the streamflow at the outlet of the system. Our results provide improved understanding of uncertainty propagation through complex water resource systems, but also portray the need for better climate and hydrological modeling in the Rocky Mountains for improved water management in the Canadian Prairies, particularly in the face of uncertain climate futures. This will be crucial if the natural headwater inflows decline and/or the system faces drought conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Human activities have caused various changes in the Earth System, and hence, the interconnections between humans and the Earth System should be recognized and reflected in models that simulate the Earth System processes. One key anthropogenic activity is water resource management that determines the dynamics of human–water interactions in time and space. There are various reasons to include water resource management in Earth System models. First, the extent of human water requirements is increasing rapidly at the global scale and it is crucial to analyze the possible imbalance between water demands and supply under various scenarios of climate change and across various temporal and spatial scales. Second, recent observations show that human–water interactions, manifested through water resource management, can substantially alter the terrestrial water cycle, affect land-atmospheric feedbacks and may further interact with climate and contribute to sea-level change. Here, we divide the water resource management into two interdependent elements, related to water demand as well as water supply and allocation. In this paper, we survey the current literature on how various water demands have been included in large-scale models, including Land Surface Schemes and Global Hydrological Models. The available algorithms are classified based on the type of demand, mode of simulation and underlying modeling assumptions. We discuss the pros and cons of available algorithms, address various sources of uncertainty and highlight limitations in current applications. We conclude that current capability of large-scale models in terms of representing human water demands is rather limited, particularly with respect to future projections and online simulations. We argue that current limitations in simulating various human demands and their impact on the Earth System are mainly due to the uncertainties in data support, demand algorithms and large-scale models. To fill these gaps, the available models, algorithms and data for representing various water demands should be systematically tested, intercompared and improved and human water demands should be considered in conjunction with water supply and allocation, particularly in the face of water scarcity and unknown future climate.},

  Abstract                 = {Assessments of potential impacts of climate change on water resources systems are generally based on the use of downscaled climate scenarios to force hydrological and water resource systems models and hence quantify potential changes in system response. This approach, however, has several limitations. The uncertainties in current climate and hydrological models can be large, such analyses are rapidly outdated as new scenarios become available, and limited insight into system response is obtained. Here, we propose an alternative methodology in which system vulnerability is analyzed directly as a function of the potential variations in flow characteristics. We develop a stochastic reconstruction framework that generates a large ensemble of perturbed flow series at the local scale to represent a range of potential flow responses to climate change. From a theoretical perspective, the proposed reconstruction scheme can be considered as an extension of both the conventional resampling and the simple delta-methods. By the use of a two-parameter representation of regime change (i.e., the shift in the timing of the annual peak and the shift in the annual flow volume), system vulnerability can be visualized in a two-dimensional map. The methodology is applied to the current water resource system in southern Alberta, Canada, to explore the system's vulnerability to potential changes in the streamflow regime. Our study shows that the system is vulnerable to the expected decrease in annual flow volume, particularly when it is combined with an earlier annual peak. Under such conditions, adaptation will be required to return the system to the feasible operational mode.},

Trading rules, market structures, and agent information structures are selected to represent emerging water quality trading programs. The analysis is designed to provide a strong test of the efficiency of trading occurring through the two market structures. The Differential Evolution algorithm is used to search for market trade strategies that perform well under multiple states of the world. Our findings suggest that trading under both bilateral and clearinghouse markets yields cost savings relatively to no trading. The clearinghouse is found to be more efficient than bilateral negotiations in coordinating point--nonpoint trading under uncertainty and transaction costs. However, the market under both structures is unlikely to achieve or even approximate least-cost pollution control allocations. Expectations of gains from water quality trading should, therefore, be tempered.},

  Abstract                 = {Although ongoing technological advances have alleviated data restrictions and most of the computational barrier to distributed modelling, lumped, parsimonious, conceptual, rainfall--runoff models are still widely used for flood forecasting. However both optimum parameter values and the fluxes of water through individual model components change significantly with the time step used. Thus such models should be used with caution in applications such as hydrograph separation or water quality studies that require the fluxes through individual flow routes through the model or which try to relate parameters to physical features of the catchment. To demonstrate this time--scale limitation, a parameter sensitivity analysis was performed on the lumped conceptual {SMARG} model for a 182 km2 rural catchment in Ireland for a number of time--steps, flow regimes and evaluation metrics. A global sensitivity analysis method ({HDMR)} showed that sensitivity indices vary greatly with time--step and evaluation metric. The sensitivity of parameters also varied for different flow regimes. Certain parameters' sensitivities remain fairly constant across both flow regimes and time--step, while others are very much regime or time--step depended. Care should be taken in using internal information from conceptual models because of this strong dependence on time--step.},

  Abstract                 = {This study presents a global analysis of urban water supply vulnerability in 71 surface-water supplied cities, with populations exceeding 750 000 and lacking source water diversity. Vulnerability represents the failure of an urban supply-basin to simultaneously meet demands from human, environmental and agricultural users. We assess a baseline (2010) condition and a future scenario (2040) that considers increased demand from urban population growth and projected agricultural demand. We do not account for climate change, which can potentially exacerbate or reduce urban supply vulnerability. In 2010, 35\% of large cities are vulnerable as they compete with agricultural users. By 2040, without additional measures 45\% of cities are vulnerable due to increased agricultural and urban demands. Of the vulnerable cities in 2040, the majority are river-supplied with mean flows so low (1200 liters per person per day, l/p/d) that the cities experience ‘chronic water scarcity’ (1370 l/p/d). Reservoirs supply the majority of cities facing individual future threats, revealing that constructed storage potentially provides tenuous water security. In 2040, of the 32 vulnerable cities, 14 would reduce their vulnerability via reallocating water by reducing environmental flows, and 16 would similarly benefit by transferring water from irrigated agriculture. Approximately half remain vulnerable under either potential remedy.},

  Abstract                 = {Global sensitivity analysis is a valuable tool in understanding flood inundation models and deriving decisions on strategies to reduce model uncertainty. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis of a one--dimensional flood inundation model ({HEC--RAS)} on the River Alzette, Luxembourg, is presented. It is impossible to define sensitivity in a unique way and different methods can lead to a difference in ranking of importance of model factors. In this paper five different methods (Sobol, {Kullback--Leibler} entropy, Morris, regionalised sensitivity analysis and regression) are applied and the outcomes on selected examples compared. It is demonstrated that the different methods lead to completely different ranking of importance of the parameter factors and that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions about the relative sensitivity of different factors. Moreover, the uncertainty inherent in the sensitivity methods is highlighted.},

  Abstract                 = {A global sensitivity analysis with regional properties is introduced. This method is demonstrated on two synthetic and one hydraulic example. It can be shown that an uncertainty analysis based on one-dimensional scatter plots and correlation analyses such as the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient can lead to misinterpretations of any model results. The method which has been proposed in this paper is based on multiple regression trees (so called Random Forests). The splits at each node of the regression tree are sampled from a probability distribution. Several criteria are enforced at each level of splitting to ensure positive information gain and also to distinguish between behavioural and non-behavioural model representations. The latter distinction is applied in the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation ({GLUE)} and regional sensitivity analysis ({RSA)} framework to analyse model results and is used here to derive regression tree (model) structures. Two methods of sensitivity analysis are used: in the first method the total information gain achieved by each parameter is evaluated. In the second method parameters and parameter sets are permuted and an error rate computed. This error rate is compared to values without permutation. This latter method allows the evaluation of the sensitivity of parameter combinations and thus gives an insight into the structure of the response surface. The examples demonstrate the capability of this methodology and stress the importance of the application of sensitivity analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Cities around the world are increasingly involved in climate action and mitigating greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions. However, in the context of responding to climate pressures in the water sector, very few studies have investigated the impacts of changing water use on {GHG} emissions, even though water resource adaptation often requires greater energy use. Consequently, reducing {GHG} emissions, and thus focusing on both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change in planning and managing urban water supply systems, is necessary. Furthermore, the minimization of {GHG} emissions is likely to conflict with other objectives. Thus, applying a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm ({MOEA}), which can evolve an approximation of entire trade-off (Pareto) fronts of multiple objectives in a single run, would be beneficial. Consequently, the main aim of this paper is to incorporate {GHG} emissions into a {MOEA} framework to take into consideration both adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change for a city's water supply system. The approach is applied to a case study based on Adelaide's southern water supply system to demonstrate the framework's practical management implications. Results indicate that trade-offs exist between {GHG} emissions and risk-based performance, as well as {GHG} emissions and economic cost. Solutions containing rainwater tanks are expensive, while {GHG} emissions greatly increase with increased desalinated water supply. Consequently, while desalination plants may be good adaptation options to climate change due to their climate-independence, rainwater may be a better mitigation response, albeit more expensive.},

  Abstract                 = {Parameter estimation for hydrological models is complicated for many reasons, one of which is the arbitrary emphasis placed, by most traditional measures of fit, on various magnitudes of the model residuals. Recent research has called for the development of robust diagnostic measures that provide insights into which model structural components and/or data may be inadequate. In this regard, the flow duration curve ({FDC}) represents the historical variability of flow and is considered to be an informative signature of catchment behavior. Here we investigate the potential of using the recently developed conditioned entropy difference metric ({CED}) in combination with the Kling-Gupta efficiency ({KGE}). The {CED} respects the static information contained in the flow frequency distribution (and hence the {FDC}), but does not explicitly characterize temporal dynamics. The {KGE} reweights the importance of various hydrograph components (correlation, bias, variability) in a way that has been demonstrated to provide better model calibrations than the commonly used Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, while being explicitly time-sensitive. We employ both measures within a multi-objective calibration framework and achieve better performance over the full range of flows than obtained by single-criteria approaches, or by the common multi-objective approach that uses log-transformed and un-transformed data to balance fitting of low- and high-flow periods. The investigation highlights the potential of {CED} to complement {KGE} (and vice versa) during model identification. It is possible that some of the complementarity is due to {CED} representing more information from moments {\textgreater} 2 than {KGE} or other common metrics. We therefore suggest that an interesting way forward would be to extend {KGE} to include higher moments, i.e. use different moments as multiple criteria.},

A robust sensitivity analysis increases the transparency of the model and provides both the modeller and the system manager with a better understanding and insight on how the model simulates reality and management operations.
 In this study, a robust, density-based sensitivity analysis, developed by Plischke et al. (2013), is applied to an {eWater} Source river management model. This sensitivity analysis methodology is extended to not only account for main effects but also for interaction effects. The combination of sensitivity indices and scatter plots enables the identification of major linear effects as well as subtle minor and nonlinear effects.
 The case study is an idealized river management model representing typical conditions of the southern Murray–Darling Basin in Australia for which the sensitivity of a variety of model outcomes to variations in the driving forces, inflow to the system, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, is examined. The model outcomes are most sensitive to the inflow to the system, but the sensitivity analysis identified minor effects of potential evapotranspiration and nonlinear interaction effects between inflow and potential evapotranspiration.},

An advection--diffusion model of the vertical transport of heat and water vapor in the atmosphere is presented as a first--order model of climatic and hydrological variability. The model generates variability with the observed spectrum. The model is validated with a correlation analysis of temperature and water vapor concentration measurements from the {TIROS} operational vertical sounder ({TOVS).} Drought frequency analyses based on synthetic lognormal streamflows with the above power spectrum are presented. We show that the presence of long memory as implied by the power--law power spectrum has a significant effect on the likelihood of extended droughts compared with the drought hazard implied from standard autoregressive models with short memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamical and statistical downscaling of multidecadal global climate models provides finer spatial resolution information for climate impact assessments [Wilby and Fowler, 2010]. Increasingly, some scientists are using the language of “prediction” with respect to future regional climate change and impacts [e.g., Hurrell et al., 2009; Shapiro et al., 2010], yet others note serious reservations about the capability of downscaling to provide detailed, accurate predictions [see Kerr, 2011]. Dynamic downscaling is based on regional climate models (usually just the atmospheric part) that have finer horizontal grid resolution of surface features such as terrain [Castro et al., 2005]. Statistical downscaling uses transfer functions (e.g., regression relationships) representing observed relationships between larger-scale atmospheric variables and local quantities such as daily precipitation and/or temperature [Wilby and Fowler, 2010]. These approaches have been successful in improving the skill of numerical weather prediction. Statistical downscaling can also be used as the benchmark (the control) against which dynamic downscaling skill is judged [Landsea and Knaff, 2000]},

  Abstract                 = {Summary
This paper presents a novel framework for undertaking climate change impact studies, which can be used for testing the robustness of precautionary climate change allowances used in engineering design. It is illustrated with respect to fluvial flood risk in the {UK}. The methodology departs from conventional scenario-led impact studies because it is based on sensitivity analyses of catchment responses to a plausible range of climate changes (rather than the time-varying outcome of individual scenarios), making it scenario-neutral. The method involves separating the climate change projections (the hazard) from the catchment responsiveness (the vulnerability) expressed as changes in peak flows. By combining current understanding of likelihood of the climate change hazard with knowledge of the sensitivity of a given catchment, it is possible to evaluate the fraction of climate model projections that would not be accommodated by specified safety margins. This enables rapid appraisal of existing or new precautionary allowances for a set of climate change projections, but also for any new set of climate change projections for example arising from a new generation of climate models as soon as they are available, or when focusing on a different planning time horizon, without the need for undertaking a new climate change impact analysis with the new scenarios. The approach is demonstrated via an assessment of the {UK} Government’s 20\% allowance for climate change applied in two contrasting catchments. In these exemplars, the allowance defends against the majority of sampled climate projections for the 2080s from the {IPCC}-{AR}4 {GCM} and {UKCP}09 {RCM} runs but it is still possible to identify a sub-set of regional scenarios that would exceed the 20\% threshold.},

  Abstract                 = {This study contributes one of the largest parallel scalability experiments ever attempted within the water resources literature to date, encompassing 2000 years of computational time. A severely challenging multiobjective benchmark problem focusing on urban water portfolio planning under uncertainty in the Lower Rio Grande Valley ({LRGV}) is used to demonstrate that a multi-master variant of the Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm ({MOEA}) can be used efficiently on more than 524,288 compute cores. The scalability of the multi-master Borg {MOEA} enables users to compress up to 20 years of computational work into 20 minutes of actual wall-clock time. Beyond these temporal efficiency gains, metric-based statistical assessments of solution quality show that the multi-master Borg {MOEA} dramatically enhances the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm's auto-adaptive search features. Theoretical algorithmic analysis shows that the multi-master Borg {MOEA} could maintain high levels of parallel scalability on future exascale computing platforms (i.e., millions of compute cores). These results mark a fundamental expansion of the scope, computational demands, and difficulties that can be addressed in multiobjective water resources applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper summarizes results from the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project ({DMIP)} study. {DMIP} simulations from twelve different models are compared with both observed streamflow and lumped model simulations. The lumped model simulations were produced using the same techniques used at National Weather Service River Forecast Centers ({NWS-RFCs)} for historical calibrations and serve as a useful benchmark for comparison. The differences between uncalibrated and calibrated model performance are also assessed. Overall statistics are used to compare simulated and observed flows during all time steps, flood event statistics are calculated for selected storm events, and improvement statistics are used to measure the gains from distributed models relative to the lumped models and calibrated models relative to uncalibrated models. Although calibration strategies for distributed models are not as well defined as strategies for lumped models, the {DMIP} results show that some calibration efforts applied to distributed models significantly improve simulation results. Although for the majority of basin-distributed model combinations, the lumped model showed better overall performance than distributed models, some distributed models showed comparable results to lumped models in many basins and clear improvements in one or more basins. Noteworthy improvements in predicting flood peaks were demonstrated in a basin distinguishable from other basins studied in its shape, orientation, and soil characteristics. Greater uncertainties inherent to modeling small basins in general and distinguishable inter-model performance on the smallest basin (65 km2) in the study point to the need for more studies with nested basins of various sizes. This will improve our understanding of the applicability and reliability of distributed models at various scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Preference articulation in multi-objective optimization could be used to improve the pertinency of solutions in an approximated Pareto front. That is, computing the most interesting solutions from the designer's point of view in order to facilitate the Pareto front analysis and the selection of a design alternative. This articulation can be achieved in an a priori, progressive, or a posteriori manner. If it is used within an a priori frame, it could focus the optimization process toward the most promising areas of the Pareto front, saving computational resources and assuring a useful Pareto front approximation for the designer. In this work, a physical programming approach embedded in an evolutionary multi-objective optimization is presented as a tool for preference inclusion. The results presented and the algorithm developed validate the proposal as a potential tool for engineering design by means of evolutionary multi-objective optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel methodology to perform adaptive Water Demand Forecasting ({WDF}) for up to 24 h ahead with the aim to support near real-time operational management of smart Water Distribution Systems ({WDSs}). The novel {WDF} methodology is exclusively based on the analysis of water demand time series (i.e., demand signals) and makes use of Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks ({EANNs}). It is implemented in a fully automated, data-driven and self-learning Demand Forecasting System ({DFS}) that is readily transferable to practice. The main characteristics of the {DFS} are: (a) continuous adaptability to ever changing water demand patterns and (b) generic and seamless applicability to different demand signals. The {DFS} enables applying two alternative {WDF} approaches. In the first approach, multiple {EANN} models are used in parallel to separately forecast demands for different hours of the day. In the second approach, a single {EANN} model with a fixed forecast horizon (i.e., 1 h) is used in a recursive fashion to forecast demands. Both approaches have been tested and verified on a real-life {WDS} in the United Kingdom ({UK}). The results obtained illustrate that, regardless of the {WDF} approach used, the novel methodology allows accurate forecasts to be generated thereby demonstrating the potential to yield substantial improvements to the state-of-the-art in near real-time {WDS} management. The results obtained also demonstrate that the multiple-{EANN}-models approach slightly outperforms the single-{EANN}-model approach in terms of {WDF} accuracy. The single-{EANN}-model approach, however, still enables achieving good {WDF} performance and may be a preferred option in engineering practice as it is easier to setup/implement.},

  Abstract                 = {While current rates of sea level rise and associated coastal flooding in the New York City region appear to be manageable by stakeholders responsible for communications, energy, transportation, and water infrastructure, projections for sea level rise and associated flooding in the future, especially those associated with rapid icemelt of the Greenland and West Antarctic Icesheets, may be outside the range of current capacity because extreme events might cause flooding beyond today’s planning and preparedness regimes. This paper describes the comprehensive process, approach, and tools for adaptation developed by the New York City Panel on Climate Change ({NPCC}) in conjunction with the region’s stakeholders who manage its critical infrastructure, much of which lies near the coast. It presents the adaptation framework and the sea-level rise and storm projections related to coastal risks developed through the stakeholder process. Climate change adaptation planning in New York City is characterized by a multi-jurisdictional stakeholder–scientist process, state-of-the-art scientific projections and mapping, and development of adaptation strategies based on a risk-management approach.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for sensitivity analysis ({SA)} of model output is introduced. It is based on the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test ({FAST)} and allows the computation of the total contribution of each input factor to the output's variance. The term "total" here means that the factor's main effect, as well as all the interaction terms involving that factor, are included. Although computationally different, the very same measure of sensitivity is offered by the indices of Sobol'. The main advantages of the extended {FAST} are its robustness, especially at low sample size, and its computational efficiency. The computational aspects of the extended {FAST} are described. These include (1) the definition of new sets of parametric equations for the search-curve exploring the input space, (2) the selection of frequencies for the parametric equations, and (3) the procedure adopted to estimate the total contributions. We also address the limitations of other global {SA} methods and suggest that the total-effect indices are ideally suited to perform a global, quantitative, model-independent sensitivity analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The Office of Hydrologic Development ({OHD)} of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\^{a}}{\quotedblbase}{\textcent}s ({NOAA)} National Weather Service ({NWS)} conducted the second phase of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project ({DMIP} 2). After {DMIP} 1, the {NWS} recognized the need for additional science experiments to guide its research-to-operations path towards advanced hydrologic models for river and water resources forecasting. This was accentuated by the need to develop a broader spectrum of water resources forecasting products (such as soil moisture) in addition to the more traditional river, flash flood, and water supply forecasts. As it did for {DMIP} 1, the {NWS} sought the input and contributions from the hydrologic research community. {DMIP} 1 showed that using operational precipitation data, some distributed models could indeed perform as well as lumped models in several basins and better than lumped models for one basin. However, in general, the improvements were more limited than anticipated by the scientific community. Models combining so-called conceptual rainfall-runoff mechanisms with physically-based routing schemes achieved the best overall performance. Clear gains were achieved through calibration of model parameters, with the average performance of calibrated models being better than uncalibrated models. {DMIP} 1 experiments were hampered by temporally-inconsistent precipitation data and few runoff events in the verification period for some basins. Greater uncertainty in modeling small basins was noted, pointing to the need for additional tests of nested basins of various sizes. {DMIP} 2 experiments in the Oklahoma ({OK)} region were more comprehensive than in {DMIP} 1, and were designed to improve our understanding beyond what was learned in {DMIP} 1. Many more stream gauges were located, allowing for more rigorous testing of simulations at interior points. These included two new gauged interior basins that had drainage areas smaller than the smallest in {DMIP} 1. Soil moisture and routing experiments were added to further assess if distributed models could accurately model basin-interior processes. A longer period of higher quality precipitation data was available, and facilitated a test to note the impacts of data quality on model calibration. Moreover, the {DMIP} 2 calibration and verification periods contained more runoff events for analysis. Two lumped models were used to define a robust benchmark for evaluating the improvement of distributed models compared to lumped models. Fourteen groups participated in {DMIP} 2 using a total of sixteen models. Ten of these models were not in {DMIP} 1. This paper presents the motivation for {DMIP} 2 Oklahoma experiments, discusses the major project elements, and describes the data and models used. In addition, the paper introduces the findings, which are covered in a companion results paper (Smith et al., this issue). Lastly, the paper summarizes the {DMIP} 1 and 2 experiments with commentary from the {NWS} perspective. Future papers will cover the {DMIP} 2 experiments in the western {USA} mountainous basins.},

  Abstract                 = {The severity of damaging human--induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450--600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry--season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the {\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\AA}{\textquotedblleft}dust bowl{\~{A}}{\textcent}{\^{a}}{\quotesinglbase}$\neg${\"{\i}}{\textquestiondown}$\sfrac{1}{2}$ era and inexorable sea level rise.

  Abstract                 = {The range of possibilities for future climate evolution needs to be taken into account when planning climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. This requires ensembles of multi-decadal simulations to assess both chaotic climate variability and model response uncertainty. Statistical estimates of model response uncertainty, based on observations of recent climate change, admit climate sensitivities—defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide—substantially greater than 5 K. But such strong responses are not used in ranges for future climate change because they have not been seen in general circulation models. Here we present results from the 'climateprediction.net' experiment, the first multi-thousand-member grand ensemble of simulations using a general circulation model and thereby explicitly resolving regional details. We find model versions as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models but with climate sensitivities ranging from less than 2 K to more than 11 K. Models with such extreme sensitivities are critical for the study of the full range of possible responses of the climate system to rising greenhouse gas levels, and for assessing the risks associated with specific targets for stabilizing these levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last 20 years, climate models have been developed to an impressive level of complexity. They are core tools in the study of the interactions of many climatic processes and justifiably provide an additional strand in the argument that anthropogenic climate change is a critical global problem. Over a similar period, there has been growing interest in the interpretation and probabilistic analysis of the output of computer models; particularly, models of natural systems. The results of these areas of research are being sought and utilized in the development of policy, in other academic disciplines, and more generally in societal decision making. Here, our focus is solely on complex climate models as predictive tools on decadal and longer time scales. We argue for a reassessment of the role of such models when used for this purpose and a reconsideration of strategies for model development and experimental design. Building on more generic work, we categorize sources of uncertainty as they relate to this specific problem and discuss experimental strategies available for their quantification. Complex climate models, as predictive tools for many variables and scales, cannot be meaningfully calibrated because they are simulating a never before experienced state of the system; the problem is one of extrapolation. It is therefore inappropriate to apply any of the currently available generic techniques which utilize observations to calibrate or weight models to produce forecast probabilities for the real world. To do so is misleading to the users of climate science in wider society. In this context, we discuss where we derive confidence in climate forecasts and present some concepts to aid discussion and communicate the state-of-the-art. Effective communication of the underlying assumptions and sources of forecast uncertainty is critical in the interaction between climate science, the impacts communities and society in general.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a scientific consensus regarding the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This has led to substantial efforts to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Despite these efforts, we are committed to substantial further changes over at least the next few decades. Societies will therefore have to adapt to changes in climate. Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global, but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions. Adaptation is most relevant as an influence on decisions which exist irrespective of climate change, but which have consequences on decadal time-scales. Even in such situations, climate change is often only a minor influence; perhaps helping to restrict the choice of ‘no regrets’ strategies. Nevertheless, if climate models are to provide inputs to societal decisions, it is important to interpret them appropriately. We take climate ensembles exploring model uncertainty as potentially providing a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty and thus a non-discountable climate change envelope. An analysis pathway is presented, describing how this information may provide an input to decisions, sometimes via a number of other analysis procedures and thus a cascade of uncertainty. An initial screening is seen as a valuable component of this process, potentially avoiding unnecessary effort while guiding decision makers through issues of confidence and robustness in climate modelling information. Our focus is the usage of decadal to centennial time-scale climate change simulations as inputs to decision making, but we acknowledge that robust adaptation to the variability of present day climate encourages the development of less vulnerable systems as well as building critical experience in how to respond to climatic uncertainty.},

Journal of the American Water Resources Association ({JAWRA}) 47(6):1183–1196. {DOI}: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00589.x Abstract:  Water resources management is in a difficult transition phase, trying to accommodate large uncertainties associated with climate change while struggling to implement a difficult set of principles and institutional changes associated with integrated water resources management. Water management is the principal medium through which projected impacts of global warming will be felt and ameliorated. Many standard hydrological practices, based on assumptions of a stationary climate, can be extended to accommodate numerous aspects of climate uncertainty. Classical engineering risk and reliability strategies developed by the water management profession to cope with contemporary climate uncertainties can also be effectively employed during this transition period, while a new family of hydrological tools and better climate change models are developed. An expansion of the concept of “robust decision making,” coupled with existing analytical tools and techniques, is the basis for a new approach advocated for planning and designing water resources infrastructure under climate uncertainty. Ultimately, it is not the tools and methods that need to be revamped as much as the suite of decision rules and evaluation principles used for project justification. They need to be aligned to be more compatible with the implications of a highly uncertain future climate trajectory, so that the hydrologic effects of that uncertainty are correctly reflected in the design of water infrastructure.},

  Abstract                 = {We present two methods for the estimation of main effects in global sensitivity analysis. The methods adopt Satterthwaite's application of random balance designs in regression problems, and extend it to sensitivity analysis of model output for non-linear, non-additive models. Finite as well as infinite ranges for model input factors are allowed. The methods are easier to implement than any other method available for global sensitivity analysis, and reduce significantly the computational cost of the analysis. We test their performance on different test cases, including an international benchmark on safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal originally carried out by {OECD/NEA.}},

  Abstract                 = {A hybrid approach to the regularized inversion of highly parameterized environmental models is described. The method is based on constructing a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities, and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space. The decomposition is used to construct super parameters. Super parameters are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least squares objective function. These eigenvectors define orthogonal axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from the calibration data. The coordinates of the solution are sought within this subspace. Super parameters are estimated using a regularized nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg scheme. Though super parameters are estimated, Tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on base parameters. Tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. Use of a large number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects pertaining to small-scale parameter variations. Because the number of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far less than the number of base parameters used to define the original problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem is reduced. The hybrid methodology is described and applied to a simple synthetic groundwater flow model. It is then applied to a real-world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. The approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling disciplines.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past 50 years, human water use has more than doubled and affected streamflow over various regions of the world. However, it remains unclear to what degree human water consumption intensifies hydrological drought (the occurrence of anomalously low streamflow). Here, we quantify over the period 1960–2010 the impact of human water consumption on the intensity and frequency of hydrological drought worldwide. The results show that human water consumption substantially reduced local and downstream streamflow over Europe, North America and Asia, and subsequently intensified the magnitude of hydrological droughts by 10–500\%, occurring during nation- and continent-wide drought events. Also, human water consumption alone increased global drought frequency by 27 (±6)\%. The intensification of drought frequency is most severe over Asia (35 ± 7\%), but also substantial over North America (25 ± 6\%) and Europe (20 ± 5\%). Importantly, the severe drought conditions are driven primarily by human water consumption over many parts of these regions. Irrigation is responsible for the intensification of hydrological droughts over the western and central {US}, southern Europe and Asia, whereas the impact of industrial and households’ consumption on the intensification is considerably larger over the eastern {US} and western and central Europe.

  Abstract                 = {Overuse of surface water and an increasing reliance on nonrenewable groundwater resources have been reported over various regions of the world, casting significant doubt on the sustainable water supply and food production met by irrigation. To assess the limitations of global water resources, numerous indicators have been developed, but they rarely consider nonrenewable water use. In addition, surface water over-abstraction is rarely assessed in the context of human and environmental water needs. Here, we perform a transient assessment of global water use over the historical period 1960–2010 as well as the future projections of 2011–2099, using a newly developed indicator: the blue water sustainability index ({BlWSI}). The {BlWSI} incorporates both nonrenewable groundwater use and nonsustainable water use that compromises environmental flow requirements. Our results reveal an increasing trend of water consumed from nonsustainable surface water and groundwater resources over the historical period (∼30\%), and this increase is projected to continue further towards the end of this century (∼40\%). The global amount of nonsustainable water consumption has been increasing especially since the late 1990s, despite a wetter climate and increasing water availability during this period. The {BlWSI} is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the renewability and degradation of surface water and groundwater resources as a result of human water over-abstraction.},

  Abstract                 = {Advances in our ability to model complex environmental systems are currently driven by at least four needs: (1) the need for the inclusion of uncertainty in monitoring, modelling and decision--making; (2) the need to provide environmental predictions everywhere; (3) the need to predict the impacts of environmental change; and (4) the need to adaptively evolve observation networks to better resolve environmental systems and embrace sensing innovations. Satisfying these needs will require improved theory, improved models and improved frameworks for making and evaluating predictions. All of these improvements should result in the long--term evolution and improvement of observation systems. In the context of this paper we discuss current bottlenecks and opportunities for advancing environmental modelling with and without local observations of system response. More realistic representations of real--world thresholds, nonlinearities and feedbacks motivates the use of more complex models as well as the consequent need for more rigorous evaluations of model performance. In the case of gauged systems, we find that global sensitivity analysis provides a widely underused tool for evaluating models' assumptions and estimating the information content of data. In the case of ungauged systems, including the modelling of environmental change impacts, we propose that the definition of constraints on the expected system response provides a promising way forward. Examples of our own work are included to support the conclusions of this discussion paper. Overall, we conclude that an important bottleneck currently limiting environmental predictions lies in how our model evaluation and identification approaches are extracting, using and evolving the information available for environmental systems at the watershed scale.

  Abstract                 = {Hydrology does not yet possess a generally agreed upon catchment classification system. Such a classification framework should provide a mapping of landscape form and hydro--climatic conditions on catchment function (including partition, storage, and release of water), while explicitly accounting for uncertainty and for variability at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This framework would provide an organizing principle, create a common language, guide modeling and measurement efforts, and provide constraints on predictions in ungauged basins, as well as on estimates of environmental change impacts. In this article, we (i) review existing approaches to define hydrologic similarity and to catchment classification; (ii) discuss outstanding components or characteristics that should be included in a classification scheme; and (iii) provide a basic framework for catchment classification as a starting point for further analysis. Possible metrics to describe form, hydro--climate, and function are suggested and discussed. We close the discussion with a list of requirements for the classification framework and open questions that require addressing in order to fully implement it. Open questions include: How can we best represent characteristics of form and hydro--climatic conditions? How does this representation change with spatial and temporal scale? What functions (partition, storage, and release) are relevant at what spatial and temporal scale? At what scale do internal structure and heterogeneity become important and need to be considered?},

  Abstract                 = {Public policies must be devised in spite of profound uncertainties about the future. When there are many plausible scenarios for the future, it may well be impossible to construct any single static policy that will perform well in all of them. It is likely, however, that the uncertainties that confront planners will be resolved over the course of time by new information. Thus, policies should be adaptive – devised not to be optimal for a best estimate future, but robust across a range of plausible futures. Such policies should combine actions that are time urgent with those that make important commitments to shape the future and those that preserve needed flexibility for the future. In this paper, we propose an approach to policy formulation and implementation that explicitly confronts the pragmatic reality that policies will be adjusted as the world changes and as new information becomes available. Our suggested “adaptive” approach allows policymakers to cope with the uncertainties that confront them by creating policies that respond to changes over time and that make explicit provision for learning. The approach makes adaptation explicit at the outset of policy formulation. Thus, the inevitable policy changes become part of a larger, recognized process and are not forced to be made repeatedly on an ad hoc basis. This adaptive approach implies fundamental changes in the three major elements of policy-making: the analytical approach, the types of policies considered, and the decision-making process.},

  Abstract                 = {Runoff-based indicators of terrestrial water availability are appropriate for humid regions, but have tended to limit our basic hydrologic understanding of drylands – the dry-subhumid, semiarid, and arid regions which presently cover nearly half of the global land surface. In response, we introduce an indicator framework that gives equal weight to humid and dryland regions, accounting fully for both vertical (precipitation + evapotranspiration) and horizontal (groundwater + surface-water) components of the hydrologic cycle in any given location – as well as fluxes into and out of landscape storage. We apply the framework to a diverse hydroclimatic region (the conterminous {USA}) using a distributed water-balance model consisting of 53 400 networked landscape hydrologic units. Our model simulations indicate that about 21\% of the conterminous {USA} either generated no runoff or consumed runoff from upgradient sources on a mean-annual basis during the 20th century. Vertical fluxes exceeded horizontal fluxes across 76\% of the conterminous area. Long-term-average total water availability ({TWA}) during the 20th century, defined here as the total influx to a landscape hydrologic unit from precipitation, groundwater, and surface water, varied spatially by about 400 000-fold, a range of variation {\textasciitilde}100 times larger than that for mean-annual runoff across the same area. The framework includes but is not limited to classical, runoff-based approaches to water-resource assessment. It also incorporates and reinterprets the green- and blue-water perspective now gaining international acceptance. Implications of the new framework for several areas of contemporary hydrology are explored, and the data requirements of the approach are discussed in relation to the increasing availability of gridded global climate, land-surface, and hydrologic data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {{AbstractTechnological} advances in forecasting the Earth’s climate offer a potentially useful tool to support planning and management decisions in water resources. Previous research has found that the implementation of new ideas and practices are impeded by many challenges such as low forecast skill, institutional obstacles, and political disincentives to innovation. To better understand barriers to forecast use at seasonal-to-interannual, decadal, or longer time scales, this paper evaluates a diffusion of innovations ({DoI}) framework to assess the adoption of hydroclimatic forecasts by water managers in the Northeast United States. Specifically, this paper seeks to understand how five innovation characteristics, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability, influence the rate of adoption. Methods used for this analysis include the distribution of a survey, interviews, and a literature review. Results indicated that while much attention has focused on institutional obstacles, in the Connecticut River Basin obstacles were related to characteristics of the forecasts themselves. Evaluation of the {DoI} makes clear that the challenges to forecast use are common to all innovations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we discuss the multiple dimensions of water security and define a set of thematic challenges for science, policy and governance, based around cross-scale dynamics, complexity and uncertainty. A case study of the Saskatchewan River basin ({SRB}) in western Canada is presented, which encompasses many of the water-security challenges faced worldwide. A science agenda is defined based on the development of the {SRB} as a large-scale observatory to develop the underpinning science and social science needed to improve our understanding of water futures under societal and environmental change. We argue that non-stationarity poses profound challenges for existing science and that new integration of the natural sciences, engineering and social sciences is needed to address decision making under deep uncertainty. We suggest that vulnerability analysis can be combined with scenario-based modelling to address issues of water security and that knowledge translation should be coupled with place-based modelling, adaptive governance and social learning to address the complexity uncertainty and scale dynamics of contemporary water problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This study utilizes high performance computing to test the performance and uncertainty of calibration strategies for a spatially distributed hydrologic model in order to improve model simulation accuracy and understand prediction uncertainty at interior ungaged sites of a sparsely-gaged watershed. The study is conducted using a distributed version of the {HYMOD} hydrologic model ({HYMOD}\_DS) applied to the Kabul River basin. Several calibration experiments are conducted to understand the benefits and costs associated with different calibration choices, including (1) whether multisite gaged data should be used simultaneously or in a step-wise manner during model fitting, (2) the effects of increasing parameter complexity, and (3) the potential to estimate interior watershed flows using only gaged data at the basin outlet. The implications of the different calibration strategies are considered in the context of hydrologic projections under climate change. Several interesting results emerge from the study. The simultaneous use of multisite data is shown to improve the calibration over a step-wise approach, and both multisite approaches far exceed a calibration based on only the basin outlet. The basin outlet calibration can lead to projections of mid-21st century streamflow that deviate substantially from projections under multisite calibration strategies, supporting the use of caution when using distributed models in data-scarce regions for climate change impact assessments. Surprisingly, increased parameter complexity does not substantially increase the uncertainty in streamflow projections, even though parameter equifinality does emerge. The results suggest that increased (excessive) parameter complexity does not always lead to increased predictive uncertainty if structural uncertainties are present. The largest uncertainty in future streamflow results from variations in projected climate between climate models, which substantially outweighs the calibration uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT:} Severe drought is a recurring problem for the United States, as illustrated by widespread economic, social, and environmental impacts. Recent drought episodes and the widespread drought conditions in 1996, 1998, and 1999 emphasized this vulnerability and the need for a more proactive, risk management approach to drought management that would place greater emphasis on preparedness planning and mitigation actions. Drought planning has become a principal tool of states and other levels of government to improve their response to droughts. For example, since 1982, the number of states with drought plans has increased from 3 to 29. Many local governments have also adopted drought or water shortage plans. Unfortunately, most state drought plans were established during the 1980s and early 1990s and emphasize emergency response or crisis management rather than risk management. This paper presents a substantive revision of a 10--step drought planning process that has been applied widely in the United States and elsewhere. The revised planning process places more weight on risk assessment and the development and implementation of mitigation actions and programs. The goal of this paper is to encourage states to adopt this planning process in the revision of existing drought plans or, for states without plans, in the development of new plans.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in model development, calibration, uncertainty analysis, scenario analysis, and, hence, decision making. With the availability of different sensitivity analysis techniques, selecting an appropriate technique, monitoring the convergence and estimating the uncertainty of the sensitivity indices are very crucial for environmental modelling, especially for distributed models due to their high non--linearity, non--monotonicity, highly correlated parameters, and intensive computational requirements. It would be useful to identify whether some techniques outperform others with respect to computational requirements, reliability, and other criteria. This paper proposes two methods to monitor the convergence and estimate the uncertainty of sensitivity analysis techniques. One is based on the central limit theorem and the other on the bootstrap technique. These two methods are implemented to assess five different sensitivity analysis techniques applied to an environmental model. These techniques are: the Sobol' method, the Morris method, Linear Regression ({LR)}, Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis ({RSA)}, and non--parametric smoothing. The results show that: (i) the Sobol' method is very robust in quantifying sensitivities and ranking parameters despite a large number of model evaluations; (ii) the Morris method is efficient to rank out unimportant parameters at a medium cost; (iii) the non--parametric smoothing is reliable and robust in quantifying the main effects and low--order interactions while requiring a small number of model evaluations; finally (iv) the other two techniques, that is, {LR} and {RSA}, should be used with care.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of hydrologic models requires that appropriate data be selected for model calibration. In the research presented here, the shuffled complex evolution ({SCE-UA)} global optimization method was used to calibrate the {NWSRFS-SMA} conceptual rainfall-runoff flood forecasting model of the {US} National Weather Service, using a 40-year record of historical data. Based on 344 calibration runs using different lengths of data from different sections of the historical record, we conclude that approximately 8 years of data are required to obtain calibrations that are relatively insensitive to the period selected. Further, the reduction in parameter uncertainty is maximal when the wettest data periods on record are used. A residual analysis is used to compare the performance of the daily root mean square ({DRMS)} and heteroscedastic maximum likelihood error ({HMLE)} objective functions. The results suggest that the factor currently limiting model performance is the unavailability of strategies that explicitly account for model error during calibration.},

  Abstract                 = {In practical engineering applications, there exist two different types of uncertainties: aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. This study attempts to develop a robust design optimization with epistemic uncertainty. For epistemic uncertainties, a possibility-based design optimization improves the failure rate, while a robust design optimization minimizes the product quality loss. In general, product quality loss is described using the first two statistical moments for aleatory uncertainty: mean and standard deviation. However, there is no metric for product quality loss defined when having epistemic uncertainty. This paper first proposes a new metric for product quality loss with epistemic uncertainty, and then a possibility-based robust design optimization. For numerical efficiency and stability, an enriched performance measure approach is employed for possibility-based robust design optimization, and the maximal possibility search is used for a possibility analysis. Three different types of robust objectives are considered for possibility-based robust design optimization: smaller-the-better type (S-Type), larger-the-better type (L-Type), and nominal-the-better type (N-Type). Examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of possibility-based robust design optimization using the proposed metric for product quality loss with epistemic uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic global vegetation models ({DGVMs)} have been shown to broadly reproduce seasonal and interannual patterns of carbon exchange, as well as realistic vegetation dynamics. To assess the uncertainties in these results associated with model parameterization, the Lund-Potsdam-Jena-{DGVM} ({LPJ-DGVM)} is analyzed in terms of model robustness and key sensitive parameters. Present-day global land-atmosphere carbon fluxes are relatively well constrained, despite considerable uncertainty in global net primary production mainly propagating from uncertainty in parameters controlling assimilation rate, plant respiration and plant water balance. In response to climate change, water-use efficiency driven increases in net carbon assimilation by plants, transient changes in vegetation composition and global warming effects on soil organic matter dynamics are robust model results. As a consequence, long-term trends in land-atmosphere fluxes are consistently modeled despite an uncertainty range of {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}3.35 {\^{A}}$\pm$ 1.45 {PgC} yr{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1 at the end of the twenty-first century for the specific scenario used.},
