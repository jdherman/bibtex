  journal = {Global Biogeochemical Cycles},

  abstract = {We conduct a sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of the land-surface
	scheme {JULES} focusing on biophysical parameters and model processes
	that govern light propagation and canopy photosynthesis. We find
	that current simulations of productivity/energy-exchange are limited
	as much by their approximate representation of complex physical processes
	as they are by the accuracy to which their biophysical parameters
	can be specified. This inference is made for three forest biomes:
	sparse, boreal needleleaf; dense, tropical broadleaf; and temperate
	broadleaf of intermediate density. Within the present study, the
	most influential biophysical parameters are light-limited quantum
	efficiency (α), the Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis at the
	top of the canopy (Vcmax) and the near-infrared transmittance of
	vegetation ({TNIR).} Assuming respective, current uncertainties of
	0.02, 20 μmol/m2/s and 0.16 in these aforementioned parameters,
	predictions of Gross Photosynthetic Product ({GPP)}, latent heat
	({LE)}, sensible heat (H) and upwelling thermal radiation (R) vary
	by ∼20\%, ∼10\%, ∼35\% and ∼0.3\%, respectively. Current
	representations of canopy photosynthesis and stomatal conductance
	yield comparable uncertainties in simulated {GPP} and {LE} and a
	∼60\% uncertainty in H. For canopy photosynthesis, explicit treatment
	of sunfleck penetration and leaf orientation are important elements
	in the calculation. Of the meteorological variables that drive the
	land-surface scheme, the downwelling fluxes of radiation in the shortwave
	and longwave vie in importance with the most influential biophysical
	parameters. The results from our study are partly biome-dependent.
	Thus ground albedo and leaf area index ({LAI)} assume greater importance
	in sparsely vegetated systems.},

	into the relative importance of catchment and climatic properties
	(rainfall, soil properties, vegetation, topography), their spatial
	variability, and their influence on temporal flow variability at
	the outlet. Our modelling approach uses a simple conceptual model
	design requiring minimal calibration and physically meaningful input
	parameters estimated a priori from landscape data or from analyses
	of streamflow recession curves. The model structure allows direct
	measurement of parameter uncertainty and the ability to investigate
	its propagation through the model to produce bounds of predictive
	uncertainty via the Monte Carlo method. This method was applied to
	a number of model designs to assess the tradeoff between model complexity,
	accuracy and predictive uncertainty, and to identify the most appropriate
	model design under specific climatic conditions. With the preferred
	model, sensitivity analysis was used to identify the dominant controls
	on streamflow variability at the hourly timescale. In summary the
	aim is not to present a distributed model of universal applicability,
	but to generate insights into the climate, soil and vegetation controls
	on streamflow variability at the hourly timescale, and on predictive
	accuracy and uncertainty, that can be used in future modelling efforts.},

  abstract = {A novel method is presented for conditioning rainfall-runoff models
	for ungauged catchment and land use impact applications. The method
	conditions the model on information from multiple regionalized response
	indices using a formal Bayesian approach. Two indices that hold information
	about soil type and land use effects are the base flow index from
	the Hydrology of Soil Type ({HOST)} classification and curve number
	from the {U.S.} Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service
	soil and land use classification. These indices are used to constrain
	a five-parameter probability distributed moisture model for subcatchments
	of the Wye (grazed grassland) and Severn (mainly afforested) catchments
	in the United Kingdom. The base flow index and curve number constrain
	only two of the five model parameters, indicating that ideally, other
	sources of information would be sought. Nevertheless, the procedure
	significantly reduces the prior uncertainty in runoff prediction
	and gives predictions close to those of the calibrated models. For
	the case study, the introduction of the curve number in addition
	to the base flow index has only a small effect on model performance
	and uncertainty; however, it allows a distinction between the effects
	of soil type and land management for the purpose of scenario analysis.
	The principal assumptions used in the method are the applicability
	of the curve number classification system and its mapping to {UK}
	soil types and the likelihood function used for Bayesian conditioning.},

  abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure
	to identify the few important factors in models with many factors.
	The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental
	ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess
	the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method
	is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor
	at a time around a baseline point are usually employed.
	
	In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary
	effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure
	and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares
	many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques,
	having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated
	by the analytical examples.
	
	The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction
	model for dimethylsulphide ({DMS)}, a gas involved in climate change.
	Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model
	reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling
	effort while some others may need to be simplified.},

	Obstacles to forecast use include a lack of awareness of their existence,

	and competition from other technological innovations. In this paper,
	ways in which seasonal forecasts might be extended to address more
	directly some concerns of South Carolina community water systems
	managers are explored. From May 1998 through August 2002, this group
	experienced drought conditions that threatened water quality and
	supply and required restrictions on water consumption. Methods for
	incorporating long lead forecasts with joint probabilities of monthly
	temperature and precipitation to produce drought forecasts are demonstrated.
	When tailored to specific places, such forecasts show the likelihood
	of exceeding drought thresholds that would trigger water use restrictions.
	The methods illustrate how long lead forecasts can be extended and
	customized into secondary products that address issues of greater
	relevance to water resource managers.},

  abstract = {The recent deployment of the {NEXRAD} ({WSR-88D)} radars in the United
	States has made spatially distributed rainfall data available in
	an operational environment. In addition, national databases now exist
	with high-resolution digital terrain-elevation, soils, and land-use
	and land-cover data. The availability of such spatially distributed
	data brings into focus the question of the utility of hydrologic
	models with spatially distributed parameters and input in an operational
	environment. Are the data and models accurate and reliable enough
	to allow their use in an operational environment? The present study
	discusses a methodology for addressing this issue based on a sensitivity
	analysis of event streamflow to parameter and radar input within
	a Monte Carlo framework for the Illinois River basin in Oklahoma
	and Arkansas. This framework allows the incorporation of parametric
	and radar-rainfall uncertainties in the analysis and illustrates
	their effects on the results of the sensitivity. The particular distributed
	model used incorporates components that are adaptations of operational
	models used often in a spatially-lumped manner to produce estimates
	of soil water, runoff and streamflow in watersheds with an area of
	order 103 km2. A {GIS} is used to sub-divide the study watershed
	into small sub-catchment units with areas of a few hundred square
	kilometers. Soil water accounting and channel routing models are
	used to generate runoff and streamflow over the network of sub-catchments
	and streams. Spatially-distributed soil databases are used to condition
	relevant soil--water model parameters to reflect the soil field capacity.
	The main conclusions are that: (a) the distributed model forced by
	{NEXRAD} data produces results comparable to those produced by the
	operational spatially-lumped models using raingauge data; (b) sensitivity
	of flow statistics on various spatial scales to parameters and radar-rainfall
	input that are uncertain is scale dependent; and (c) in view of parametric
	and input uncertainty, in several cases, a spatially lumped model
	has response that cannot be statistically distinguished from that
	of the distributed model. This study is an initial step toward understanding
	the issues surrounding the use of distributed models in an operational
	environment. Repeating the sensitivity analysis for other areas with
	different geomorphologic, soils and climate characteristics is necessary
	to investigate aspects pertaining to higher variability in soils
	and terrain elevation, and the presence of snow accumulation and
	melt. Sensitivity analysis of soil water estimates to parameters
	and radar rainfall input is also a natural extension of this work.},

	data. This paper describes the application of {MODHYDROLOG} to 28
	catchments throughout Australia with different climatic and physical
	characteristics. Four simulations are carried out on each catchment,
	the simulations differing in the numbers of model parameters optimized
	in the model calibration. The study indicates that the use of nine
	(or fewer) model parameters is sufficient to give adequate estimates
	of streamflow, and the use of four or five parameters may be sufficient
	in temperate catchments and in applications where only approximate
	estimates of runoff are required. {MODHYDROLOG} is purported to be
	â€œphysically basedâ€� and this study also indicates that
	certain model parameters can be related to the catchment characteristics.
	However, it is difficult to estimate the values of some of the â€œimportantâ€�
	parameters, and for this reason, {MODHYDROLOG} must always be calibrated
	in all modelling applications. Based on the general results from
	this study, recommendations are given in the Appendix to guide model

	that is unprecedented in some hydroclimatic records. Using gridded
	drought reconstructions that cover most of the western United States

	to an earlier period of elevated aridity and epic drought in {AD}
	900 to 1300, an interval broadly consistent with the Medieval Warm
	Period. If elevated aridity in the western United States is a natural
	response to climate warming, then any trend toward warmer temperatures
	in the future could lead to a serious long--term increase in aridity
	over western North America.}

	solutions of large sets of coupled nonlinear rate equations to uncertainties
	in the rate coefficients. This method is based on varying all the
	rate coefficients simultaneously through the introduction of a parameter
	in such a way that the output concentrations become periodic functions
	of this parameter at any given time t. The concentrations of the
	chemical species are then Fourier analyzed at time t. We show via
	an application of Weyl's ergodic theorem that a subset of the Fourier
	coefficients is related to ã€ˆâˆ‚ciâˆ•âˆ‚klã€‰,
	the rate of change of the concentration of species i with respect
	to the rate constant for reaction l averaged over the uncertainties
	of all the other rate coefficients. Thus a large Fourier coefficient
	corresponds to a large sensitivity, and a small Fourier coefficient
	corresponds to a small sensitivity. The amount of numerical integration
	required to calculate these Fourier coefficients is considerably
	less than that required in tests of sensitivity where one varies
	one rate coefficient at a time, while holding all others fixed. The
	Fourier method developed in this paper is not limited to chemical
	rate equations, but can be applied to the study of the sensitivity
	of any large system of coupled, nonlinear differential equations
	with respect to the uncertainties in the modeling parameters.},

	land-use in the northeast of England: the â€˜ruralâ€™ Ouse
	and the â€˜urbanâ€™ Aire. The analysis employed a version
	of the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test ({FAST)} that quantifies
	the contribution of changes in individual parameters and combination
	of parameters to the variance of the model output (here the {Nash--Sutcliffe)}
	in an efficient way. The quantification of the sensitivity of the
	model output to the parameters led to the identification of the most
	influential parameters. Differences between the Aire and the Ouse
	were found, reflecting their different water quality regime. Results
	highlighted the importance of interactions between two, or more,
	parameters on the model output. It led to question the one-at-a-time
	calibration method currently applied with {QUESTOR} and underlined
	the importance of including interactions between parameters in sensitivity
	analyses. Comparison of the relative influence of parameters versus
	input data showed contrasting results. In the urban system, the inputs
	from discharges (sewage treatment works and industrial effluents)
	were highly influential on model outputs and generally more important
	than the model parameters. For the rural river, the tributary discharges
	were most influential, but only at a similar or a lower level than
	the model parameters.},

  abstract = {Use of nonlinear parameter estimation techniques is now commonplace
	in ground water model calibration. However, there is still ample
	room for further development of these techniques in order to enable
	them to extract more information from calibration datasets, to more
	thoroughly explore the uncertainty associated with model predictions,
	and to make them easier to implement in various modeling contexts.
	This paper describes the use of "pilot points" as a methodology for
	spatial hydraulic property characterization. When used in conjunction
	with nonlinear parameter estimation software that incorporates advanced
	regularization functionality (such as {PEST)}, use of pilot points
	can add a great deal of flexibility to the calibration process at
	the same time as it makes this process easier to implement. Pilot
	points can be used either as a substitute for zones of piecewise
	parameter uniformity, or in conjunction with such zones. In either
	case, they allow the disposition of areas of high and low hydraulic
	property value to be inferred through the calibration process, without
	the need for the modeler to guess the geometry of such areas prior
	to estimating the parameters that pertain to them. Pilot points and
	regularization can also be used as an adjunct to geostatistically
	based stochastic parameterization methods. Using the techniques described
	herein, a series of hydraulic property fields can be generated, all
	of which recognize the stochastic characterization of an area at
	the same time that they satisfy the constraints imposed on hydraulic
	property values by the need to ensure that model outputs match field
	measurements. Model predictions can then be made using all of these
	fields as a mechanism for exploring predictive uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Over-parameterisation is a well-known and often described problem
	in hydrological models, especially for distributed models. Therefore,
	methods to reduce the number of parameters via sensitivity analysis
	are important for the efficient use of these models. This paper describes
	a novel sampling strategy that is a combination of latin-hypercube
	and one-factor-at-a-time sampling that allows a global sensitivity
	analysis for a long list of parameters with only a limited number
	of model runs. The method is illustrated with an application of the
	water flow and water quality parameters of the distributed water
	quality program {SWAT}, considering flow, suspended sediment, total
	nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate and ammonia outputs at several
	locations in the Upper North Bosque River catchment in Texas and
	the Sandusky River catchment in Ohio. The application indicates that
	the methodology works successfully. The results also show that hydrologic
	parameters are dominant in controlling water quality predictions.
	Finally, the sensitivity results are not transferable between basins
	and thus the analysis needs to be conducted separately for each study
	catchment.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to analyze the reliability of the Multi--step
	Automated Calibration Scheme ({MACS)} over a variety of climatic
	and hydrologic conditions. The authors developed {MACS} for the estimation
	of parameters for hydrologic models; be it for 'fine--tuning' of
	a priori estimates, or for estimating parameters without a priori
	knowledge of the system. Optimization methods have advanced over
	the last few decades, and although they are used extensively by the
	research community, operational hydrologists have been less eager
	to implement automated calibration procedures. The authors, under
	cooperative agreement with the National Weather Service ({NWS)} Hydrology
	Laboratory have collaborated to develop a progressive calibration
	strategy, using 'in--house' {NWS} algorithms to optimize parameters
	for the hydrologic models used in operational streamflow forecasting:
	the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting ({SAC--SMA)} and the {SNOW--17}
	model. The method, though developed within the {NWS} forecasting
	system, can be easily adapted to any hydrologic modeling system.
	In our current work, {MACS} has been tested on 20 {NWS} forecast
	points (or basins), located in various hydrologic and climatic regimes
	(five different River Forecast Centers ({RFCs))} across the United
	States. Over half of the basins tested (11) consist of multi--tiered
	systems in the Western {US} (i.e. the hydrologic models are run over
	several elevation zones for one forecast point). The results show
	comparable, reliable calibrations, similar in quality to the traditional
	manual techniques, over all of the hydro--climatic regimes used for
	this study. {MACS}, generally, produces simulations with desirable
	performance measures, including improved {Nash--Sutcliffe} efficiency
	and lower percent bias. {MACS} performs well in all regions, even
	over the complex terrain in the western regions of the United States.

	the Rhine basin for the purpose of modeling of the effect of land
	use change on the runoff. An approach to calibrate the model by associating
	the model parameters with the physical catchment characteristics
	was implemented. Land use, soil type, catchment size, and topographic
	structure were used as the bases for regionalization of the model
	parameters. Parameter values were initially associated with these
	catchment characteristics and were finally transferred into their
	catchment scale values using a transfer function, whose form was
	assumed a priori. A simultaneous model calibration was performed
	for a number of catchments with contrasting catchment characteristics.
	An optimization algorithm was used for the calibration with an objective
	function defined as the normalized sum of the squared differences
	between the modeled and the observed runoff. The regionalized model
	thus obtained was then used to model the resulting runoff for different
	land use scenarios generated in the model area. The results obtained
	suggest that increased urbanization leads to an increase in the lower
	peak runoff resulting from summer storm, while the increase in the
	higher peaks resulting from winter rainfall is very little. On the
	other hand, a considerable reduction of both the peak runoff and
	the total runoff volume resulted from intensified afforestation.},

	and conceptual model features in two stages of distributed modeling:
	model structure development and estimation of spatially variable
	parameters. The approach adds more practicality to the process of
	model parameterization, and facilitates an easier transition from
	current lumped model-based operational systems to more powerful distributed
	systems. This combination of physically-based and conceptual model
	features is implemented within the Hydrology Laboratory Research
	Modeling System ({HL-RMS).} {HL-RMS} consists of a well-tested conceptual
	water balance model applied on a regular spatial grid linked to physically-based
	kinematic hillslope and channel routing models. Parameter estimation
	procedures that combine spatially distributed and â€˜integratedâ€™
	basin-outlet properties have been developed for the water balance
	and routing components. High-resolution radar-based precipitation
	data over a large region are used in testing {HL-RMS.} Initial tests
	show that {HL-RMS} yields results comparable to well-calibrated lumped
	model simulations in several headwater basins, and it outperforms
	a lumped model in basins where spatial rainfall variability effects
	are significant. It is important to note that simulations for two
	nested basins (not calibrated directly, but parameters from the calibration
	of the parent basin were applied instead) outperformed lumped simulations
	even more consistently, which means that {HL-RMS} has the potential
	to improve the accuracy and resolution of river runoff forecasts.},

  abstract = {Four catchment grouping methods are compared in terms of their performance
	in predicting specific low flow discharges q95, i.e. the specific
	discharge that is exceeded on 95\% of all days. The grouping methods
	are the residual pattern approach, weighted cluster analysis, regression
	trees and an approach based on seasonality regions. For each group,
	a regression model between catchment characteristics and q95 is fitted
	independently. Data from 325 sub--catchments in Austria ranging in
	catchment area from 7 to 963\&\#xa0;km2 are used in the analysis.
	The performance of the methods is assessed by leave--one--out cross--validation
	of the regressionestimates, which emulates the case of ungauged catchments.
	Results indicate that the grouping based on seasonality regions performs
	best and explains 70\% of the spatial variance of q95. The favourable
	performance of this grouping method is likely related to the striking
	differences in seasonal low flow processes in the study domain. Winter
	low flows are associated with the retention of solid precipitation
	in the seasonal snow pack while summer low flows are related to the
	relatively large moisture deficits in the lowland catchments during
	summer. The regression tree grouping performs second best (explained
	variance of 64\%) and the performance of the residual pattern approach
	is similar (explained variance of 63\%). The weighted cluster analysis
	only explains 59\% of the spatial variance of q95, which is only
	a minor improvement over the global regression model, i.e. without
	using any grouping (explained variance of 57\%). An analysis of the
	sample characteristics of all methods suggests that, again, the grouping
	method based on the seasonality regions has the most favourable characteristics
	although all methods tend to underestimate specific low flow discharges
	in the very wet catchments.},

	performance in different climates, the {HBV--96} model was applied
	on four catchments located in Europe, Africa and South America. Manual,
	automatic and Monte Carlo techniques were used for model calibration
	and parameter analyses. It was found that the magnitude of the water
	balance components had a significant influence on model performance.
	Performance decreased and demands of calibration period length increased
	with increased catchment dryness primarily because of a neater water
	balance and higher climatic variability in drier areas. A large degree
	of equifinality was discovered in all catchments where different
	calibration methods yielded equally good results but with different
	parameter combinations. Thus, it may be impossible to know if an
	optimum parameter set exists and to relate parameter values to physical
	properties of the catchment. On the other hand the validation results
	indicated that it might not matter if parameter values were not unique
	when studying runoff solely, provided the model application is within
	the same regime of flows.},

	another factor. Sensitivity analysis is potentially useful in all
	phases of the modeling process: model formulation, model calibration
	and model verification. The sensitivity of model parameters should
	be recognized as a special case of the above general definition.
	Parametric sensitivity is a vital part of most optimization techniques.
	However, other facets of sensitivity need to be recognized. The time--dependent
	nature of sensitivity should be considered in the formulation of
	hydrologic models. A variety of simplified hydrologic models are
	used to demonstrate the potential of sensitivity in all phases of
	the modeling process. The failure to recognize and exploit the potential
	of sensitivity analysis results primarily from the inadequacy of
	the mathematical foundations of sensitivity. A comprehensive mathematical
	framework of sensitivity is provided and additional research needs

	using a lumped conceptual model involving 11 calibration parameters.
	We calibrate and verify the model for two non--overlapping 11--year
	periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter
	values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated
	with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs
	between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters
	can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating
	that they are able to represent the regional or large--scale differences
	in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some
	of the spatial parameter variability with coefficients of determination
	of up to R2=0.27, but usually the R2 values are lower. Parameter
	uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated
	parameters and catchment attributes to a significant extent as suggested
	by an optimised correlation analysis. The median {Nash--Sutcliffe}
	efficiencies of simulating streamflow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63
	when moving from the calibration to the verification period. This
	is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with over--parameterisation
	of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods
	for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms
	of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the
	use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream
	(nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration
	period, the average decrease in the {Nash--Sutcliffe} model efficiency,
	as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice
	the decrease of moving from the calibration to the verification period.
	The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes
	perform significantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a
	better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment
	attributes.},

	{NWS} lumped {CONT-API} model is operational in one of the {NWS}

	initial distributed parameters based on the calibrated lumped {CONT-API}
	parameters of 67 basins in the Susquehanna River Basin are derived.
	This study shows that the {CONT-API} model six-hourly calibrated
	parameters can be used in an one-hourly lumped model with only minor
	changes in total runoff volume (less than 5\%). However, to obtain
	the timing of simulated hydrographs, appropriate one-hourly unit
	hydrographs need to be derived. A priori-distributed model parameters
	were based on relationships between soil properties and calibrated
	lumped {CONT-API} parameters. Multiple linear regressions with coefficients
	of determination ranging from 0.39 to 0.63 were obtained for 10 lumped
	model parameters. Using these predicted parameters, the lumped model
	produced simulations having {Nash--Sutcliffe} efficiency, Neff, statistics
	ranging from 0.69 to 0.78 for five of the 67 basins. These are commensurate
	with goodness-of-fit statistics from lumped model calibrations. Furthermore,
	application of the method in deriving a priori parameters gave a
	promising result in distributed model simulations.},

	system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented
	in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function
	of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for

	complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical

	designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have

	plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time
	designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample
	of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely
	to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include
	a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important
	inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy
	of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational
	model.},

  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Although ongoing technological advances have alleviated data restrictions
	and most of the computational barrier to distributed modelling, lumped,
	parsimonious, conceptual, rainfall--runoff models are still widely
	used for flood forecasting. However both optimum parameter values
	and the fluxes of water through individual model components change
	significantly with the time step used. Thus such models should be
	used with caution in applications such as hydrograph separation or
	water quality studies that require the fluxes through individual
	flow routes through the model or which try to relate parameters to
	physical features of the catchment. To demonstrate this time--scale
	limitation, a parameter sensitivity analysis was performed on the
	lumped conceptual {SMARG} model for a 182 km2 rural catchment in
	Ireland for a number of time--steps, flow regimes and evaluation
	metrics. A global sensitivity analysis method ({HDMR)} showed that
	sensitivity indices vary greatly with time--step and evaluation metric.
	The sensitivity of parameters also varied for different flow regimes.
	Certain parameters' sensitivities remain fairly constant across both
	flow regimes and time--step, while others are very much regime or
	time--step depended. Care should be taken in using internal information
	from conceptual models because of this strong dependence on time--step.},

	This method is demonstrated on two synthetic and one hydraulic example.
	It can be shown that an uncertainty analysis based on one-dimensional
	scatter plots and correlation analyses such as the Spearman Rank
	Correlation coefficient can lead to misinterpretations of any model
	results. The method which has been proposed in this paper is based
	on multiple regression trees (so called Random Forests). The splits
	at each node of the regression tree are sampled from a probability
	distribution. Several criteria are enforced at each level of splitting
	to ensure positive information gain and also to distinguish between
	behavioural and non-behavioural model representations. The latter
	distinction is applied in the generalized likelihood uncertainty
	estimation ({GLUE)} and regional sensitivity analysis ({RSA)} framework
	to analyse model results and is used here to derive regression tree
	(model) structures. Two methods of sensitivity analysis are used:
	in the first method the total information gain achieved by each parameter
	is evaluated. In the second method parameters and parameter sets
	are permuted and an error rate computed. This error rate is compared
	to values without permutation. This latter method allows the evaluation
	of the sensitivity of parameter combinations and thus gives an insight
	into the structure of the response surface. The examples demonstrate
	the capability of this methodology and stress the importance of the
	application of sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes results from the Distributed Model Intercomparison
	Project ({DMIP)} study. {DMIP} simulations from twelve different
	models are compared with both observed streamflow and lumped model
	simulations. The lumped model simulations were produced using the
	same techniques used at National Weather Service River Forecast Centers
	({NWS-RFCs)} for historical calibrations and serve as a useful benchmark
	for comparison. The differences between uncalibrated and calibrated
	model performance are also assessed. Overall statistics are used
	to compare simulated and observed flows during all time steps, flood
	event statistics are calculated for selected storm events, and improvement
	statistics are used to measure the gains from distributed models
	relative to the lumped models and calibrated models relative to uncalibrated
	models. Although calibration strategies for distributed models are
	not as well defined as strategies for lumped models, the {DMIP} results
	show that some calibration efforts applied to distributed models
	significantly improve simulation results. Although for the majority
	of basin-distributed model combinations, the lumped model showed
	better overall performance than distributed models, some distributed
	models showed comparable results to lumped models in many basins
	and clear improvements in one or more basins. Noteworthy improvements
	in predicting flood peaks were demonstrated in a basin distinguishable
	from other basins studied in its shape, orientation, and soil characteristics.
	Greater uncertainties inherent to modeling small basins in general
	and distinguishable inter-model performance on the smallest basin
	(65 km2) in the study point to the need for more studies with nested
	basins of various sizes. This will improve our understanding of the
	applicability and reliability of distributed models at various scales.},

  abstract = {A new method for sensitivity analysis ({SA)} of model output is introduced.
	It is based on the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test ({FAST)} and
	allows the computation of the total contribution of each input factor
	to the output's variance. The term "total" here means that the factor's
	main effect, as well as all the interaction terms involving that
	factor, are included. Although computationally different, the very
	same measure of sensitivity is offered by the indices of Sobol'.
	The main advantages of the extended {FAST} are its robustness, especially
	at low sample size, and its computational efficiency. The computational
	aspects of the extended {FAST} are described. These include (1) the
	definition of new sets of parametric equations for the search-curve
	exploring the input space, (2) the selection of frequencies for the
	parametric equations, and (3) the procedure adopted to estimate the
	total contributions. We also address the limitations of other global
	{SA} methods and suggest that the total-effect indices are ideally
	suited to perform a global, quantitative, model-independent sensitivity
	analysis.},

  abstract = {Summary The Office of Hydrologic Development ({OHD)} of the National
	Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s ({NOAA)} National
	Weather Service ({NWS)} conducted the second phase of the Distributed
	Model Intercomparison Project ({DMIP} 2). After {DMIP} 1, the {NWS}
	recognized the need for additional science experiments to guide its
	research-to-operations path towards advanced hydrologic models for
	river and water resources forecasting. This was accentuated by the
	need to develop a broader spectrum of water resources forecasting
	products (such as soil moisture) in addition to the more traditional
	river, flash flood, and water supply forecasts. As it did for {DMIP}
	1, the {NWS} sought the input and contributions from the hydrologic
	research community. {DMIP} 1 showed that using operational precipitation
	data, some distributed models could indeed perform as well as lumped
	models in several basins and better than lumped models for one basin.
	However, in general, the improvements were more limited than anticipated
	by the scientific community. Models combining so-called conceptual
	rainfall-runoff mechanisms with physically-based routing schemes
	achieved the best overall performance. Clear gains were achieved
	through calibration of model parameters, with the average performance
	of calibrated models being better than uncalibrated models. {DMIP}
	1 experiments were hampered by temporally-inconsistent precipitation
	data and few runoff events in the verification period for some basins.
	Greater uncertainty in modeling small basins was noted, pointing
	to the need for additional tests of nested basins of various sizes.
	{DMIP} 2 experiments in the Oklahoma ({OK)} region were more comprehensive
	than in {DMIP} 1, and were designed to improve our understanding
	beyond what was learned in {DMIP} 1. Many more stream gauges were
	located, allowing for more rigorous testing of simulations at interior
	points. These included two new gauged interior basins that had drainage
	areas smaller than the smallest in {DMIP} 1. Soil moisture and routing
	experiments were added to further assess if distributed models could
	accurately model basin-interior processes. A longer period of higher
	quality precipitation data was available, and facilitated a test
	to note the impacts of data quality on model calibration. Moreover,
	the {DMIP} 2 calibration and verification periods contained more
	runoff events for analysis. Two lumped models were used to define
	a robust benchmark for evaluating the improvement of distributed
	models compared to lumped models. Fourteen groups participated in
	{DMIP} 2 using a total of sixteen models. Ten of these models were
	not in {DMIP} 1. This paper presents the motivation for {DMIP} 2
	Oklahoma experiments, discusses the major project elements, and describes
	the data and models used. In addition, the paper introduces the findings,
	which are covered in a companion results paper (Smith et al., this
	issue). Lastly, the paper summarizes the {DMIP} 1 and 2 experiments
	with commentary from the {NWS} perspective. Future papers will cover
	the {DMIP} 2 experiments in the western {USA} mountainous basins.},

	irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes
	place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely
	irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation
	of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative
	forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the
	ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly
	for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts
	that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
	increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume
	(ppmv) to a peak of 450--600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible
	dry--season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to
	those of the â€œdust bowlâ€� era and inexorable sea level
	rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative
	lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least
	0.4--1.0 m if 21st century {CO2} concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and
	0.6--1.9 m for peak {CO2} concentrations exceeding Ã¢â€°Ë†1,000
	ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions
	to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several
	meters over the next millennium or longer.}

	sensitivity analysis. The methods adopt Satterthwaite's application
	of random balance designs in regression problems, and extend it to
	sensitivity analysis of model output for non-linear, non-additive
	models. Finite as well as infinite ranges for model input factors
	are allowed. The methods are easier to implement than any other method
	available for global sensitivity analysis, and reduce significantly
	the computational cost of the analysis. We test their performance
	on different test cases, including an international benchmark on
	safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal originally carried out
	by {OECD/NEA.}},

  abstract = {A hybrid approach to the regularized inversion of highly parameterized
	environmental models is described. The method is based on constructing
	a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities,
	and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors
	representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space.
	The decomposition is used to construct super parameters. Super parameters
	are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter
	normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least
	squares objective function. These eigenvectors define orthogonal
	axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from
	the calibration data. The coordinates of the solution are sought
	within this subspace. Super parameters are estimated using a regularized
	nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg scheme. Though super parameters
	are estimated, Tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on
	base parameters. Tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and
	promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. Use of a large
	number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive
	to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects
	pertaining to small-scale parameter variations. Because the number
	of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far
	less than the number of base parameters used to define the original
	problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem
	is reduced. The hybrid methodology is described and applied to a
	simple synthetic groundwater flow model. It is then applied to a
	real-world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. The
	approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling
	disciplines.},

  abstract = {Advances in our ability to model complex environmental systems are
	currently driven by at least four needs: (1) the need for the inclusion
	of uncertainty in monitoring, modelling and decision--making; (2)
	the need to provide environmental predictions everywhere; (3) the
	need to predict the impacts of environmental change; and (4) the
	need to adaptively evolve observation networks to better resolve
	environmental systems and embrace sensing innovations. Satisfying
	these needs will require improved theory, improved models and improved
	frameworks for making and evaluating predictions. All of these improvements
	should result in the long--term evolution and improvement of observation
	systems. In the context of this paper we discuss current bottlenecks
	and opportunities for advancing environmental modelling with and
	without local observations of system response. More realistic representations
	of real--world thresholds, nonlinearities and feedbacks motivates
	the use of more complex models as well as the consequent need for
	more rigorous evaluations of model performance. In the case of gauged
	systems, we find that global sensitivity analysis provides a widely
	underused tool for evaluating models' assumptions and estimating
	the information content of data. In the case of ungauged systems,
	including the modelling of environmental change impacts, we propose
	that the definition of constraints on the expected system response
	provides a promising way forward. Examples of our own work are included
	to support the conclusions of this discussion paper. Overall, we
	conclude that an important bottleneck currently limiting environmental
	predictions lies in how our model evaluation and identification approaches
	are extracting, using and evolving the information available for
	environmental systems at the watershed scale. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM}

  abstract = {Hydrology does not yet possess a generally agreed upon catchment classification
	system. Such a classification framework should provide a mapping
	of landscape form and hydro--climatic conditions on catchment function
	(including partition, storage, and release of water), while explicitly
	accounting for uncertainty and for variability at multiple temporal
	and spatial scales. This framework would provide an organizing principle,
	create a common language, guide modeling and measurement efforts,
	and provide constraints on predictions in ungauged basins, as well
	as on estimates of environmental change impacts. In this article,
	we (i) review existing approaches to define hydrologic similarity
	and to catchment classification; (ii) discuss outstanding components
	or characteristics that should be included in a classification scheme;
	and (iii) provide a basic framework for catchment classification
	as a starting point for further analysis. Possible metrics to describe
	form, hydro--climate, and function are suggested and discussed. We
	close the discussion with a list of requirements for the classification
	framework and open questions that require addressing in order to
	fully implement it. Open questions include: How can we best represent
	characteristics of form and hydro--climatic conditions? How does
	this representation change with spatial and temporal scale? What
	functions (partition, storage, and release) are relevant at what
	spatial and temporal scale? At what scale do internal structure and
	heterogeneity become important and need to be considered?},

  abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Severe drought is a recurring problem for the United States,
	as illustrated by widespread economic, social, and environmental
	impacts. Recent drought episodes and the widespread drought conditions
	in 1996, 1998, and 1999 emphasized this vulnerability and the need
	for a more proactive, risk management approach to drought management
	that would place greater emphasis on preparedness planning and mitigation
	actions. Drought planning has become a principal tool of states and
	other levels of government to improve their response to droughts.
	For example, since 1982, the number of states with drought plans
	has increased from 3 to 29. Many local governments have also adopted
	drought or water shortage plans. Unfortunately, most state drought
	plans were established during the 1980s and early 1990s and emphasize
	emergency response or crisis management rather than risk management.
	This paper presents a substantive revision of a 10--step drought
	planning process that has been applied widely in the United States
	and elsewhere. The revised planning process places more weight on
	risk assessment and the development and implementation of mitigation
	actions and programs. The goal of this paper is to encourage states
	to adopt this planning process in the revision of existing drought
	plans or, for states without plans, in the development of new plans.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in model development,
	calibration, uncertainty analysis, scenario analysis, and, hence,
	decision making. With the availability of different sensitivity analysis
	techniques, selecting an appropriate technique, monitoring the convergence
	and estimating the uncertainty of the sensitivity indices are very
	crucial for environmental modelling, especially for distributed models
	due to their high non--linearity, non--monotonicity, highly correlated
	parameters, and intensive computational requirements. It would be
	useful to identify whether some techniques outperform others with
	respect to computational requirements, reliability, and other criteria.
	This paper proposes two methods to monitor the convergence and estimate
	the uncertainty of sensitivity analysis techniques. One is based
	on the central limit theorem and the other on the bootstrap technique.
	These two methods are implemented to assess five different sensitivity
	analysis techniques applied to an environmental model. These techniques
	are: the Sobol' method, the Morris method, Linear Regression ({LR)},
	Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis ({RSA)}, and non--parametric smoothing.
	The results show that: (i) the Sobol' method is very robust in quantifying
	sensitivities and ranking parameters despite a large number of model
	evaluations; (ii) the Morris method is efficient to rank out unimportant
	parameters at a medium cost; (iii) the non--parametric smoothing
	is reliable and robust in quantifying the main effects and low--order
	interactions while requiring a small number of model evaluations;
	finally (iv) the other two techniques, that is, {LR} and {RSA}, should
	be used with care.},

	method was used to calibrate the {NWSRFS-SMA} conceptual rainfall-runoff
	flood forecasting model of the {US} National Weather Service, using
	a 40-year record of historical data. Based on 344 calibration runs
	using different lengths of data from different sections of the historical
	record, we conclude that approximately 8 years of data are required
	to obtain calibrations that are relatively insensitive to the period
	selected. Further, the reduction in parameter uncertainty is maximal
	when the wettest data periods on record are used. A residual analysis
	is used to compare the performance of the daily root mean square
	({DRMS)} and heteroscedastic maximum likelihood error ({HMLE)} objective
	functions. The results suggest that the factor currently limiting
	model performance is the unavailability of strategies that explicitly

	global net primary production mainly propagating from uncertainty
	in parameters controlling assimilation rate, plant respiration and
	plant water balance. In response to climate change, water-use efficiency
	driven increases in net carbon assimilation by plants, transient
	changes in vegetation composition and global warming effects on soil
	organic matter dynamics are robust model results. As a consequence,
	long-term trends in land-atmosphere fluxes are consistently modeled
	despite an uncertainty range of −3.35 ± 1.45 {PgC} yr−1 at the
	end of the twenty-first century for the specific scenario used.},
